the kitchen stinks .
i'll throw out the garbage .
so dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
coffee ? i don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff .
come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .
what ’ s wrong with that ? cigarette is the thing i go crazy for .
are things still going badly with your houseguest ?
getting worse . now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . i ’ ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . he makes himself at home , which is fine . but what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and i had company over ! that was the last straw .
leo , i really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . i know he used to be your best friend in college , but i really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .
you ’ re right . everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . i ’ ll keep you informed .
would you mind waiting a while ?
well , how long will it be ?
i'm not sure . but i'll get a table ready as fast as i can .
ok . we'll wait .
are you going to the annual party ? i can give you a ride if you need one .
thanks a lot . that's the favor i was going to ask you for .
isn ’ t he the best instructor ? i think he ’ s so hot . wow ! i really feel energized , don ’ t you ?
i swear , i ’ m going to kill you for this .
what ’ s wrong ? didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !
oh , yeah ! i had a blast ! i love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . sorry , i ’ m just not into this health kick .
oh , no , get off it . it wasn ’ t such a killer class . you just have to get into it . like they say , no pain , no gain .
i am wiped out . thank you .
look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ?
never ! but thank you for inviting me .
can i take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ?
well , i want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak . could she have something else instead ?
certainly . how about spaghetti with clams and shrimps .
sounds delicious . ok . she'll try that .
can you manage chopsticks ?
why not ? see .
good mastery . how do you like our chinese food ?
oh , great ! it's delicious . you see , i am already putting on weight . there is one thing i don't like however , msg .
what's wrong with msg ? it helps to bring out the taste of the food .
according to some studies it may cause cancer .
oh , don't let that worry you . if that were true , china wouldn't have such a large population .
i just happen to have a question for you guys . why do the chinese cook the vegetables ? you see what i mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
i'm exhausted .
okay , let's go home .

i'll just go and check it for you , sir .
may i sit here ?
by all means .
is everything to your satisfaction ?
no , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
oh ! sorry to hear that . this is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .

i'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . could you show me what you have ?
sure , we have several different styles you may choose . how high of a heel do you want ?
not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best .
in that case , i might have just the pair for you . look at these , they were made in italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . you can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made .
those are beautiful . do you have any in a size six ?
yes , we do , we also have this same style in dark blue and red .
no , thank you . i'm just looking for a black pair .
let me go to the back and get them . i'll be right back .
are you ok ?
i'm fine . i'm just so touched by the sad story .
so i can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . which scene is your favorite ?
i love them all . but if i had to name one as the best , i would say it's the ending .
what's it about ? you know , i couldn't help falling asleep .
did you ? i didn't notice that . but still you should know it , for you have seen it with laura before .
i guess i've done the same thing last time i was here with her , too . i mean falling asleep . for me , this one is not that attractive .
then i doubt if you like operas at all .
yes . i like carmen very much . but i don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .
ok , then . the man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . when he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .
very impressive . and i do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .
me , too . there was always a good round of applause every time she sings .
yes , the applause ! that was what kept waking me up during the show .
and it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . just amazing !
no doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .
exactly .
did anyone call ?
just mr . white .
what did he want ?
he wouldn't say over the phone .
could i have the check , please ?

i like winner's english very mush . you know the beijing olympic games is right around the corner . we should learn english well . it's on fm 96.6 , china business radio . you can get it on your radio too .
but i don't speak english at all .
that's ok . the program is especially for the beginners like us .
really ? when is it on ?
it begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
thank you so much . i'll try and catch that .
the radio has brought us lots of convenience .
yes , i can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
with the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
so we should take the advantage of it .
do you have these shoes in a size 7 ?
yes . let me get you a pair .
what a mess !
sorry . i'll clean it up .
i wonder if we can change to channel 5 .
why ?
i want to know what's on that channel .
oh , good .
there is a football match .
i prefer tv play to football .
ok . could you turn it down ?
what are you going to do ?
i'm going to listen to the radio .
maybe we can enjoy the tv play together . it's interesting .
excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ?

may i speak to peter ?
who's calling ?
it's so boring .
don't you like it ?
i don't . is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?
i think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .
do you mind if we switch over ?
well , i'd rather see a movie .
what's the movie ?
' star war ' .
it must be interesting .
yes , you're right .
excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ?
it's a portable tv . it's a popular thing now .
oh , that's new to me . so what's on everyday ?
news about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .
is there anything interesting ?
yes , there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
yes , 50 yuan per month .
it is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it .
yeah . you know driving is boring . tv can get me out of the fatigue of driving .
it can also entertain your passengers like me .
that's the point .
jenny , you're too lazy . you should do some exercise . see , you're getting fat .
dad , it's raining outside .
that is your excuse .
all right , all right , i will go swimming with peter this afternoon .
peter , enough with your computer games . go do your homework now .

no ! stop playing computer games !
mom , i'll be finished soon .
hi , who has the remote control ?
i do . why , do you want me to change the channel ?
yes , please . i can't stand watching the channel any more .
i think they have pretty good programmes . but i'll change it if you really want .

oh , i hate channel 5 . i'd rather just listen to the radio .
don't make such a fuss . i'm sure you will like today's programme .
what's on today ?
a basketball match between chinese team and american team .

thank you for your compliment . but you are exaggerating . i think you are destined to be a singer . you have the best voice !
thank you . maybe we can sing a song together . would you like to sing with me ?
yes , i'd like to . it's my honor . let's pick a song .
how about this one ?
sorry , i can't sing the song .
er ... how about this one ?
ok . but i'm not familiar . i don't know the beginning part .
never mind . you can follow me . i'll sing the first part .

peter , go and tidy up your toys now .
wait a moment , mom .
i'm mad ! i said now ! turn off the tv , and do it now .
mom , just ten more minutes . the show is going to be over soon .
sorry , i'm late .
it doesn't matter .
excuse me , i've been waiting here for 10 minutes . do you know how often does no . 636 run ?
it runs every 15 minutes . you must have missed it .
it seems you got here at good time . do you have a bus schedule ?
yes , i do . you can buy a bus schedule in a news stand .
i see , thank you . by the way , is this the right bus for the museum ?
yes , it is .
do i have to change ?
no . the museum is the terminal of this bus .
thanks a lot .
you are welcome .
mom , can i have more allowance ?
what for ?
i want to buy more books .
oh , yeah ? are you joking ?
of course not ! i'm telling the truth .
honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . but $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already .
two burgers , please .
for here or to go ?
dad , may i have a room of my own ?
oh , honey , i'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
dad , but i don't want to share a room with peter . he snores every night .
honey , you can ask him to be quite . otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
open the book and turn to page 10 .
it is difficult .
no , honey , it's easy if you know the way .
do i have to memorize it ?
peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert .
mom , can i have some ice cream ?
not today , honey . don't eat too much ice cream .
mom , can i have one more piece of cake ?
dad , can you help me ?
oh , honey , you made a mistake .
i don't know how to do it .
ok . let's do it together .
16 divided by 2 . what's the answer ?
16 divided by 2 equals 8 .
how was your test ?
it was bad .
oh , honey , you should study harder .
but i already tried my best .
is bob home ?
sorry . you've got the wrong number .
dad , how do you say this word ?

no , honey , go and read it . you'll learn .

no , mom . i didn't .
did somebody hit you ? or did you just fall ?
something's wrong with my air conditioning .
leave it to me . i'll fix it .
mom , i don't feel well .
are you sick ?
i feel dizzy .
let me take your temperature .
mom , i don't want to go to see a doctor .
oh , honey , i think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot .
what do you want to be ?
dad , i haven't thought about it . i'm still young .
oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ?
i like playing the piano .
where are you off to ?
the movies .
may i have the menu , please ?
sure . here you go .
peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ?
no , mom . piano is for girls .
well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like jay chou .
no way , mom . i don't like piano .
ok . but you have to promise me that you will study hard in your english class .
all right , all right . i understand .
jenny , can you come and help me ?
mom , what should i do ?
it's dusty everywhere in the house . can you help me do the housecleaning ?
ok . i will call peter to clean it together .
mom , what are we going to make tonight ?

mom , the water is boiling !
honey , just turn down the stove .

no , it's too loud in here .
it's your turn now , helen .
ok . i'm coming .
this is your song . i picked it for you .
thank you . you are so considerate .
push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
ok . this key is too high for me .
i think it's a piece of cake for you .
ok . let me have a try ...
well done ! i hope i can sing as well as you one day .
thank you . i'm sure you will .
dinner's ready ! come and get it !
coming !
have you got a minute ?

it's peter's turn .

be quiet . he is singing .
i thought he only liked to listen !
so did i .
he has a really good voice !
can you pass me the lighter ?
here . catch !
have you ever sung with a karaoke ?
yes , i do it quite often .
karaoke has become a major entertainment . i wonder why .
simple , it's fun .
how much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ?
ah , that's the biggest fun of all . you see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you .
i wouldn't do that .
but i like the feeling .
what kind of music do you like ?
i like popular music best .
me too .
who is your favorite singer ?
qi in is .
do you know this song ?
yes , i like it very much .

it's for you .
how much does this cost ?
sixty dollars .
may i use your phone ?
go ahead .
where's the toilet ?
over there .
watch out , jenny ! be careful of the cars .
i'm fine , dad .
did you get hit ?
no , dad . can i go there to play ball ?
do you shop online often ?
every so often . it is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores .
are there many things online ?
books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores .
incredible . i really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket .
even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' but it now ' prices .
what are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ?
some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived .
peter , it's time to go home now ! hurry up !
ten more minutes , mom . please !
honey , it's almost noon . we have to go home and make lunch for your sister .
i bet she will hang around with her mates after school .
don't tell me you're pregnant again .
i'm afraid so .
i am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . but it requires having an online banking account . is it necessary ?
indeed . online banking enables you to make on-line shopping .
do you know how to get the bank account ?
bring your id card and fill out a form . that will be fine .
so easy .
i think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than atm processing speed .
honey , i need to have a talk with you .
dad , i have to do my homework .
no , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?
dad , i don't want to talk about it now .
honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
i'm sorry , dad . but i would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ?
absolutely we need a house here . but what makes me upset is the prices in this city .
our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here .
it is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher .
more and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry .
and the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live .
have you watched the tv series , humble abode ?
yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars .
stop burping .
i can't help it .
can you give me a hand ?
of course .
let's go now .
i'll be with you in a minute .
kate , can we change the channel ?
why ?
this channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good tv programs .
ok . you can change it .
what about this one ? do you like this program ?
no , i think it is very boring . can you change it to channel twelve , please ?
yes . oh , it's a talk show .
yeah , it's very funny . have you ever watched it before ?
no , i haven't . this is my first time to watch it .
i'm sure you will like it .
mom , can i watch tv ?
no more today , honey .
alright , mom . should i turn off the tv right now ?
yes , honey . go to your room , and take out your book . it's your reading time now .
mom , where is the remote ? i can't find it .
just go to read . i will find it , honey .
ok , tom . it's your turn . are you ready ?
i really would rather just listen . isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
come on ! in the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !
i know , but ... hey , jim's here ! i've been waiting to hear him sing all night .
well , you asked for it . why don't you put on an elvis song for him ? he loves ' the king ' .
i'll put the song at the front of the list .
can you give me a hand with my luggage ?
of course .
peter , have you seen my purse ?
no , mom . i haven't seen it .
that's strange . it should be on the desk .
mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ?
hello , i'm sorry for calling this late . may i speak to peter ?
i'm sorry . he's not in right now .
when is he coming back ?
he should be back in ten minutes . could 1 you call back later ?
i received an e-mail from mother today .
what did she say ?
she missed us and asked when we would go back home .
what's your plan ?
i don't know . maybe next week . we haven't been to the great wall yet .
right , then you'd better send an e-mail to tell her .
these vegetables taste very sweet .
sure , i planted them . they're organic .
really ? dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ?
well , it's a secret .
dad , come on ! just tell me .
well , honey , i can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn .
do you know anything about health food ?
it is so popular among people to preserve health now , so i read some books about health food .
can you give me some examples ?
drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy .
really ? why we must have warm and fresh water ?
warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . and freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system .
anything else ?
yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . if you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable .
our dinner is ready .
what do we have for the dinner now ?
potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber .
do you feed rabbits ?
it is said that greens can improve our metabolism . in addition , i want to keep fit .
where is my favorite white bread ? is it in refrigerator ?
i didn't buy any of it at all . most health food are good for you , but don't taste good .
do you prepare some dessert for me ?
i am clear about your sweet tooth , so i made a mixed fruit dish for you .
are you trying to change our eating patterns ?
how much was your watch ?
take a guess .
mom , did you see andy's dog ?
honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also .
mom , please . can i have a pet dog like andy's ?
honey , you know , we don't have enough room for a pet dog .
mom , we can keep it on the balcony , right ?
no , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . i'm sorry .
jenny , what are you going to do tomorrow morning ?
i don't know yet . what's your idea , dad ?
i'm thinking of taking you and peter swimming . what do you think ?
dad ! it's cold now !
dad , i've finished my homework .
well , what game do you want to play ?
do you want to play poker ?
do you know how to play it ?
i'll teach you .
ok . teach me how to play the game .
i would like to buy a black suit .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
no , i never wear suit in my everyday life . i just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony .
i see . have a look at this one . it ’ s very cheap because it ’ s not very durable .
but it looks good . let me try it on .
ok , the mirror is over there .
are you being served , madam ?
no . um , do you carry any padded coat ?
yes , what size is in your mind ?
small size .
any particular brand ?
whatever . you know , i ’ m thinking of a gift for my mother . it ’ s her 60 birthday next friday . could you give me some advice ? you are the expert .
how about this one ? it ’ s the latest design , simple but elegant .
looks nice . how much do you charge ?
$ 100 .
that ’ s sheer robbery . i ’ m sure you can do better than that .
how much would you say ?
$ 80 .
can i see these silk ties ?
no problem .
i ’ ll take this one .
good . anything else ? the tie pins ? the cuff links ?
no , thank you . i want to have a look at that scarf .
ok . we have several kinds of scarves here . let me get them for you . just wait a minute .
did your eye doctor prescribe you contact lenses ?
no , i ’ d like to know something about contact lenses .
oh , i see . we have both hard and soft contact lenses . they are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses .
i have found i ’ m short-sighted recently . i need to wear glasses . as a student , it ’ s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses .
we have many kinds of glasses here . which frames do you like best ?
i think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me .
what about this pair ? they are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . try them on .
they fit me very well . i like them .
may i help you , madam ?
yes . i ’ m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . can you recommend some to me ?
yes . your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be
these look wonderful . do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
of course . if there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
i ’ ll take them .

yes we do . check the meat department . there is a fish counter there too .
i already looked , but did not see anything .
let me show you .
thanks .
see , it's right over there .
oh , gosh . i didn't see it .
that's all right .
could you show me some scarves ?
what kind of scarf shall i show you ? we have them in all sorts and sizes .
show me some of the latest fashion , please .
at your service . will this suit you ?
yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce .
this is chinese made .
let me try it on . i think it really suits me . can you give me some discount on it ?
yes , it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price .

it should be handwashed with cold water . it's a common sense . don't you know it ?

that's all right . please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . you can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . i think it fits you .

i ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . tomorrow is her birthday . and i know she needs a woolen sweater .
how do you like this grey one ? it ’ s pure wool , one hundred percent of xinjiang wool .

do you have magazines now ?
yes , i do .
can you lend me one ?
is that the latest issue of reader you're reading ?
yes , it is . it has some really good articles in it .
i know . i have been a subscriber for the past two years .
i didn't know that . how much does it cost to subscribe ?
i'm not exactly sure , but it's not that expensive at all .
i used to subscribe to it , but i cancelled my subscription last year .
why did you do that ?
i was the only person in my family reading it . everyone in my family just likes to read fashion .
please give me a piece of ' new york daily ' .
you are late . the last piece has sold out .

what ’ s the matter with them ?
look at the heels . they are slanting .
ah , i can do it perfectly .
how much does it cost ?
6 yuan . and i can make them as new as before .

what can i offer you here ?
i came here to ask for some information .
ok . please go ahead .
i bought a pair of trousers last year , which i like the best . but this year they don ’ t fit me very well . they ’ re tight in the waist , baggy at the knees . can you make some alterations ?

i'd like to buy some milk powder . what would you recommend ?
we have many kinds of different purpose . i wonder whom you are buying for ?
my son . he is two years old .
i see , sir . this one is very good .
is it ?
you may rest assured . it sells well .
may i have a look at the introduction ?
hey , ann . wake up . it's time to get out of bed .
oh , dad . do i have to get up right now ?
yes , or you'll be late .
why didn't my alarm go off today ?
it went off 30 minutes ago .
i must have slept right through it .
rise and shine .
ok . i know .
ouch ! i just bit my tongue .
oh , that hurts .
are you going grocery shopping today ?
i am , as a matter of fact . do you have any special requests ?
yes , please get some white bread , thick cut , some ham , not the processed stuff , some gouda cheese , some galla apples and . . .
wait . this is sounding like a major list . why don't you just come with me ?
i want to get in shape . i feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy .
i know what you mean . i fit into my clothes , but i'm not always comfortable .
would you like to get in shape together ?
what do you have in mind ?
how about going to the gym ? there's one really close to work .
i know the one you mean . do you know how much the memberships are ?
as a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now .
let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities .
ahahah ! what is that thing on your couch ! it just moved !
did you think it wasn't real ? that's my pet lizard .
you have a pet lizard ? somehow i never would have imagined that .
his name is grunt . come closer and i'll properly introduce you .
does it bite or scratch ?
no , he's perfectly harmless . and he's not afraid of strangers either . here , hold him .
wow . he's heavy ! and his skin feels really cool .
stick around and you'll get to know him better . he has a very unusual personality .
mom . i have to go school shopping . there's only one more week left .
do you need money or what ?
i have this list of stuff that i need and i only have half the dough .
half the dough huh . well . how would you like to earn the other half ?
do i have a choice ? uh . that's a no . what can i do ?
i thought you'd never ask . the lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned .
we can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days .
oh , that's right . they're filming a movie up there , aren't they ?
some high speed chase scene , i think .
i wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that .
i think that they get a pretty good payoff .
the movie company has to pay them ?
i don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity !
oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see !
may i help you , sir ?
yes , i have many things to buy . i would like to choose the cleaning milk first .
all right . what is your type of skin ?
dry . that's my problem .
you can use this . it has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . it has this lotion , as a gift attached .
sounds good . what about shampoo ? i would like to buy the product that prevents scurf .
how about this one ? it is well-known for the effect of removing scurf .
is it a newcomer ?
yes , it is a new brand .
i do not care the brand as long as it works well .
anything else ?
i want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of jiajieshi .
welcome . may i help you ?
use , i want a eye-shadow .
we have different colours of eye-shadow . may i know what colour you usually wear ?
purple . but today , i'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour .
yes , i see . how do you like this one ?
may i have a try ?
certainly .
it's still too dark . any brighter colours ?
not from this brand , i'm afraid .
what about other brands ?
how about this one ?
oh , that's the very thing i need .
hey , mom , look what i found !
good heavens ! don't bring that frog in the house .
who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?
i did , mom .
can you tell me what's included in your warranty ?
certainly . the product has a two-year guarantee . if it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . this covers you for a further two years .
i see . what does that include ?
it covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
what sort of response time do you guarantee ?
our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . we guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
are there any exclusions ?
not really . it's a very comprehensive warranty . i ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .
i'm so sorry about your brother , mr . wang .
thanks , jane .
i need something to wash this down . is there any juice in the fridge ?
what is that ? it looks like something from a swamp !
it's a green drink . it's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
you know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
the sales lady said that even if i eat right , i wouldn't get enough vitamins .
have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
it's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
it may take less time , but i don't know about easier . yuck .
hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast .
dad ! i don't have time ! i'll be late for school !
you won't make it through the day without breakfast .
dad , i never eat breakfast .
breakfast is brain food . maybe that's why your grades are suffering .
uh ! dad !
don't ' uh , dad ' me . sit down and have some lovely breakfast .
alright . you win . please pass the brain food .
what do you think about all the different diets that people go on ?
i don't think dieting is good for you . it's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .
so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ?
sure , they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .
and have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
i used to take vitamins every day , but i don't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this , but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
would you like to have some icecream ? i've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . i've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline .
wow ! so many choices you have ! i wish i could , but i just can't . i'm on a diet to lose weight .
come on , just a bite . it doesn't really hurt to have just a bite .
i'd better not . please don't tempt me . please !
gee ! you are really strong-willed .
you're damn right . i'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that i think is wrong .
can you help me out , chuck ?
sure . what's it , yvonne ?
i want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
okay , you take one end and i'll take the other .
it's time to go . are you ready ?
almost . let me get my bag .
how do you put this seat back ? i know there is a lever somewhere .
what are you doing ?
i'm getting dressed , what does it look like ?
it looks like you are about to get dressed . did you forget we are in a car on the road ?
i'm good at this . nobody will see anything .
are you kidding ? you're going to cause an accident just from people gawking !
all right , pull over at that service station and i'll dress in the ladies ' room .
that will be my pleasure .
mark , can you dress the twins for me while i take a shower ?
you don't know what you are asking !
please ! you can do it . their clothes are all laid out on the bed .
remember what happened last time ?
are you referring to kc getting her head stuck in the pant leg ?
yes . that was a bit terrifying for both of us .
don't worry ! today they are wearing dresses !
oh , in that case , sure ! uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ?
hello . welcome !
hello . i'd like to have my nails manicured .
this way please . we offer multiple manicure services here . do you want a full service ?
i don't need the full service .
but the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now .
no , thanks . all i need is painting and polishing .
ok . please sit down . i hope you will be satisfied with our service .
thanks very much .
you have a lovely house , jack .
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out , and i'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . last week , i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
i've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
well , i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
wow , you really do have a talent for this , alice . thanks for the suggestions .
would you like a piece of birthday cake ?
no , thanks , i'll pass . it looks very tempting though .
i thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ?
it is . i'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it .
a diet ? what for ? you are in great shape .
i went to the doctor the other day . my cholesterol is up .
oooo . this sounds serious .
not too serious . but he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down .
are you ready to order yet , sir ?
yes , i think so . i ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine .
yes , sir . it'll be a moment .
ok .
mom , are those tattoos on your brows ?
uh , yes , they are .
moooooommmmm ! you're so in ! anything else you've been keeping from me ?
what ?
any body piercing ? stick out your tongue !
oh , for pete's sake . this is cosmetic . my brows are falling out . i did this for convenience .
come on mom . i'm your a ! wait till the guys hear about this !
mike , don't even think about it !
oh , my god ! i look so old . i look as if i were 40 . i think it's time for some plastic surgeries . i'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin .
i don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! you'd better stop being so ridiculous .
anyway i think i need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
i think you need to get a brain surgery . honestly speaking , you look charming .
i know what you mean . i just want to make myself more attractive .
you are fine the way you are . besides , plastic surgery hurts .
really ?
sure it is . so you'd better get rid of this idea .
i only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .
okay . is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?
it's natural . my friend told me you know how to work with curls .
that's my specialty . let me put this around your neck .
do you have any product that controls frizz ?
with the cut i'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
thank you !
and when we're done , i'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest .
what can i do for you ?
i am looking for cologne , small bottle . can i see that one in the glass shelf ?
yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan .
it's too expensive .
if you think it's expensive . you can look at this one .
what's the difference between the two ?
it's difficult to explain . but this one is really cheap .
let me see .
excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ?
it costs only 25 yuan .
oh , it's too expensive . can't you make it any cheaper ?
the price is reasonable because the quality is super .
but the price is too high .
how much would you like it to be , then ?
what about 15 yuan ?
let's meet half way , 20 yuan , ok ?
all right , i'll take it .
i think you've got a real bargain .
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
good morning . i'm interested in antiques . do you have any ?
yes , we have a great variety of chinese antiques .
what do you have ?
well , we have some painting and some porcelain . which do you like better ?
i'd like porcelain .
good . how about the table set ?
oh , it looks well . i like it very much .
it's made in jingdezhen .
how much is it ?
one thousand eight hundred yuan .
it's not expensive . i'll take it .
good morning , madam . what can i do for you ?
can you show me some traditional chinese arts and crafts ?
maybe sandalwood fan is good .
would you show me some ?
of course .
they really smell fragrant . how much is a real sandalwood fan ?
the small ones are one hundred yuan for each . and the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
i'll take two small ones and a big one .
what else are you interested in ?
i'm afraid not .
i would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .
there are many stores selling handcrafts in paris . our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . you can take your time and choose whatever you like .
well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
you have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . the tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . the design on it is traditional paris architecture .
how much is it ?
100 frances .
mmm , it is reasonable . look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
we have a piece of table clothing to go with it . it is a brocade one with pretty stars .
this silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
you are right .
i will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
ok . do you like these candles ? they are on sale now .
did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?
yes , several times .
how do you like them ?
not bad .
i always have the temptation to eat something there .
then , why didn't you do that ?
i don't know how much we can trust them . do you have any ideas ?
some of them , i think , are not good .
it doesn't taste good ?
no , i mean some of them are not clean enough .
that's my greatest concern . but how can you tell which one is clean ?
i judge by appearances .
i got it . i think it's worth trying .
it certainly is .
i'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
don't try everything at one time , please .
it is my first time coming to china . i want to buy something unique of china to my friends as gifts .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like them ?
yes , i love them , but they are fragile . it is not convenient to take them .
you are right . how about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
sounds good . may i have a look ?
of course . these paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
they are beautiful , but i can't understand the connotation in them . let me see the handkerchiefs .
all right . chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
oh , i like the bamboo design . what is this ?
this is a series of animals , called chinese zodiac .
good . so i will take three series and five bamboo ones .
ok , i will wrap them for you .
is there anything i can do for you ?
would you please show me that mural ?
certainly . here you are .
it looks so beautiful . how much is it ?
four hundred yuan .
that's a bit more than i wanted to pay . can you cut the price down a bit ?
i'm sorry . ours is a fixed price shop and i can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
maybe you are right . ok , i'll take it .
well , i'll have it wrapped for you .
thank you . here is four hundred yuan .
mom , is there anything in the fridge i can eat before dinner ?
there's some leftover pizza from last night .
anything else ?
um , i think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day .
do i have any other choices ?
there might be some birthday cake left in the freezer .
is everything in the fridge leftovers ? i hate leftovers !
you can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and i'll make dinner !
you are looking really healthy lately . what are you doing differently ?
thank you for noticing ! i've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .
tell me about it . i'm interested .
well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .
ha ! that's right . you used to smoke . i forgot !
when i kicked that habit , i found i had so much more energy . i started exercising .
at the gym ?
no . i like to be outside . i took up hiking and mountain biking .
yes ! i finally lost that last five pounds i've been working on forever !
how did you finally do it ?
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
like snacking ?
you know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
i get what you mean .
instead , i sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
i'm impressed . good for you !
this book i'm reading about yoga is really interesting .
i didn't know you did yoga .
i don't really practice it regularly yet , i'm just learning about it .
what have you learned ?
right now i'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly .
as opposed to short and shallow ?
yes . it says here , ' he who only half breathes , half lives . '
i read something like that once . i think it was , ' life is in the breath . '
good evening , madam . may i help you ?
i want a facial . but this is the first time i've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ?
sure . most facials start with a thorough cleaning . then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . after that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin .
that's exactly what i want . how long does it take ?
we have half-hour and one-hour treatments .
what's the regular price ?
well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . if you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do .
good , i will take the one hour facial with make-up .
that's fine , madam .
by the way , could you give me a manicure ? use a light nail-polish , please .
why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?
i don't want to .
well , come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv , for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner , will you ?
i will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh , no . you know i hate it .
where is your dressing room ?
right over there .
( person a comes out of the dressing room ) how did you like the sweater ?
i loved it . i'll take it .
great . i can ring you up over here . it comes to $ 87.04 .
here you go ?
do you have a credit card with us ?
no i don't .
if you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today .
not today . thanks though .
no problem . we always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know .
sure .
is there anything else i can help you with ?
yeah . i was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . do you have alteration services here ?
yes . it cost $ 7 , and it takes one day .
great . thanks for your help .
we have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight .
yes , what can i do for you , sir ?
i'm calling to see if i can request a specific table .
i can try to arrange that for you .
i proposed to my wife in your restaurant and i would like the same table if i can .
can you describe for me , where you were sitting ?
it was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf .
you're in luck . we still have that little table .
hi . can i help you with anything ?
yeah . can i look at this ring ?
sure . let me get it out for you . what is your size ?
i believe i am a six .
here you go .
would you have any necklace that would go well with this ?
actually , we have a few to choose from . they are over here .
there's no price tag on this necklace .
oh . i'm sorry . i'll check the price for you . it is $ 199 .
this necklace is a little short . do you have one that is longer ?
yes . why don't you try this one on .
this one is much better . can i try on the ring with this necklace ?
sure . here you go .
let me think about it .
sure . take your time .
thank you for all the help .
the portions here are man sized . we usually end up taking half of the meal home with us .
everything looks so good . is there anything in particular that you recommend ?
hey , sis . you know me , if i don't like everything on the menu , i don't go back to the restaurant !
so you're saying i can't go wrong with anything i order ? in that case ...
wait , you love salmon , don't you ? they have the best salmon pasta .
that sounds really good ! does it come with a soup ?
soup and bread and salad bar ! i'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !
i see what you mean !
i've never been to a restaurant like this before .
it's really different , isn't it ?
that's a good word to describe it .
i hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for .
i am hungry . i think i could eat a large by myself .
well , let's order one for starters .
i'm in the mood for a californian .
that happens to be my favorite . waiter , i think we're ready to order .
dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ?
we're going over to mrs . smith's place to help her with her yard work .
yard work ? i said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work !
it will be fun . and besides , you'll be in the best company .
dad . you're so cute . what do i need to do to help get ready ?
you could get the rakes and some shovels together and i'll put them in the car .
jeans and a tee shirt , right ?
yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool .
ah , here we are .
this is the place i was telling you about .
would you like to sit near the window ?
good .
let's have a look at the menu . oh , there isn't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
yes , of course . excuse me . could you possibly let us see your menu ? oh . they haven't got one either .
what can i get for you today , sir ?
i would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar .
would you like anything else with that ?
how fresh is that apple pie over there ?
our pie is brought in fresh every day . and i can tell you it's delicious .
okay , throw in a piece of that pie then .
is this to stay or to go ?
i'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . thanks for asking .
excuse me . can i ask you a question ?
sure . what is it ?
i don't know how to say it in english .
we call this a ' parking meter ' .
oh , thank you . but how do you spell it ?
p-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r .
would you mind giving me a hand ?
okay , bob , what is it ?
help me hang up this picture , please . would you hold it straight while i put in the nail ?
all right .
now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please .
yes , here you are .
there ! how does it look ? tell me if i've got it straight .
well , it's straight , but it's upside down i'm afraid .
mom , i want to get a motorcycle . is that all right with you ?
you mean a murder cycle ? did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ?
mom ! i'll wear a helmet and i'll drive sane . i promise .
i'll tell you what . you can get a motorcycle on one condition .
what's that ?
you spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an emt trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
and after that ?
after that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , i mean motorcycle .
did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? there was a sixty-two-car pile up .
no kidding ! when did that happen ?
early this morning .
oh , no .
yeah . and a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . you can imagine what happened after that .
sixty two cars . oath . do they know how many casualties yet ?
the count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition .
that's amazingly low for such a huge accident !
honey , i think i need to go see the doctor .
ah ! you're bleeding all over ! what happened ?
i was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .
here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . does it hurt ?
no , not really , there's just a lot of blood .
you may just need stitches . i think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the er . let me make a quick phone call .
i'm going to go sit in the car while i still have the stomach to walk .
oh , sorry ! i forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . i'll be right there .
this is 911 .
send an ambulance fast ! my husband is having a heart attack !
slow down and tell me your address .
i live on 1177 oak lane in smithfield . oh , hurry , i don't know what to do !
an ambulance is on its way right now . they should be there any minute . are you close to him right now ?
yes , yes , he's right here by me .
is he breathing ?
yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! oh , please hurry !
bob , would you come and help me ?
of course . what do you want me to do , mom ?
could you hold these packages while i look for the key ?
alright , what's in them ? they are so heavy !
just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
well , hurry up and open the door please . i told you these things are heavy .
i'm sorry , but i just can't find the key . you must have it .
oh , yes , it's in my pocket . but how can i get the key while i'm holding all these bags ?
hello , miao li , where are you going ?
hello , i am going to the store to buy some fruit .
oh , would you do me a favor ?
yes ?
please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
sure . do you want it to be registered ?
yes , i think so . there are some pictures in it . it would be a great pity if they were lost .
yes , i will be glad to mail your letter .
thanks .
you are welcome .
good afternoon .
good afternoon . can i help you ?
i've got this important letter to send to hainan . can i send it by registered mail ?
certainly .
how much will i have to pay ?
two yuan , please .
here are the letter and the money .
wait a moment . it seems that your letter is overweight . let me weight it .
is it overweight ?
i'm afraid it is . so you will have to pay two yuan extra . the total charge is four yuan .
all right . here is the money .
here are the stamps and your receipt .
what shall i do with the receipt ?
you can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . it is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive .
thank you .
not at all .
can i help you , miss ?
do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ?
what is your skin type ?
my skin is kind of oily .
this nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand .
how much is it ?
$ 60.the price is reasonable for its large quantity . what's more , there are some gifts attaching for you .
sounds good . what are the gifts attaching ?
you can take one tonic or hand cream .
i will choose the tonic .
no problem . you can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it .
that's the very thing i want .
excuse me . can you show me some nail-polish ?
yes . we have all kinds of colors for it .
that's good .
what's your favorite color ?
in my opinion , orange is very nice .
sometimes pink is not bad , too .
you're right . well , just these two , please .
thank you . anything else ?
i can't believe the way our landlord cheated us .
i know how you feel . i had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago . fortunately , the one we have now is very nice .
yes , sir ?
could we have the bill , please ?
that's 68 pounds altogether , please .
that's alright . here you are .
be careful . the floor is wet .
what happened ?
can you give me a hand , tom ?
sure .
can you open this bottle for me ? the cork seems to be stuck .
i'll have a go .
don't tell me that's your lunch ?
no , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch !
a candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! that's all junk !
this is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ...
sugar , sugar , preservatives , fats , more sugar , more fat , more preservatives !
at least i enjoy my lunch ! what's in your bag ?
my wife sent me with rice , vegetables , and some curry chicken .
there's the difference , your wife made it ! i have to make my own lunch !
can you shorten this pipe for me ? it's too long .
sure . i'll do it after lunch . what length do you need ?
can you take 15 mm of it ?
yes , no problem . it'll be ready by 2 p . m .
mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ?
everything about them was different , even the theaters .
i'm really interested . tell me about them .
well , where i grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family .
that's cool . i bet you could bring your own food .
we did . on hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .
why don't we do that anymore ?
well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot .
do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?
yes , g stands for general audiences , pg means parental guidance suggested , r is restricted to audiences under 18 and x means explicit content .
does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
remember when we were kids ? theaters wouldn't let kids in to pg moves without a parent .
i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed .
now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
yea , i never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
( a stranger stops to help ) everything ok ?
no ! my tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . now my engine is on fire !
i think that's just steam . your engine's overheated .
do you know a lot about cars ?
a little bit . i'll take a look if you want me to .
please . thank you so much for stopping .
yeah , she's hot . radiator's leaking . looks like you were running her pretty hard .
that must have been just before i got the speeding ticket .
did you have an accident recently ... hey , wait a second ! i know this car !
you do ?
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name's hal .
i'm akimbo . nice to meet you , i guess .
boy , i'm sure sorry about your car . hey , akimbo , i wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
what kind of deal ?
i'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
you don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
i'd rather not . they'll raise my rates . it'll cost me more in the long run .
if you give me cash , do you care if i don't fix the car ?
hell , i don't care . just don't submit a report to your insurancecompany .
it's a deal , hal . thanks again for stopping to help . and thanks for smashing my car !
who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?
i did . why ?
didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?
no , i didn't . i'm sorry . it won't happen again .
i'm going crazy .
what's the matter ?
i've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
well , if there is anything i can do to help , let me know .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i'm trying to choose a gift .
did you have anything particular in mind ?
no , but i'd like to get something typical in this region .
well , we have some handmade products . let me show you some .
they're quite nice . but i'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive .
about how much were you planning to spend ?
no more than one hundred yuan .
oh , in that case . this one is ok .
oh ! it's perfect . i think i'll take it . would you wrap it , please ?
this is the house i want to rent .
could you tell me the advantages of it ?
no problem . first , it's comfortable and cozy . second , it has a lovely view of the city . third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .
there is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?
200 dollars per week .
in my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth , the room is so large that i can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
your intention is good , but i still can't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .
don't you think i can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where i work ?
i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
twice a week for work and once for shopping .
in my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
chinese tea is famous all over the world . i want to buy several boxes .
there are various kinds of tea in china . it depends on the taste and effect .
well , i do not know chinese tea at all .
this is green tea , you can drink it in summer . it can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs .
sounds interesting . what about this ?
it is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion .
what's this ? it smells fragrant .
it is jasmine tea of high quality . it is fragrant and has a pleasant taste .
i will take the jasmine tea . could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? it is a gift for my friend .
no problem . wait for a moment .
can i help you ?
i'd like to buy some chinese-style cakes . could you recommend me some ?
certainly . what about moon cake ? it's typical chinese food .
moon cakes ? what is that ?
the moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . that's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony .
sounds very interesting . i'll buy some to family people .
all the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , cantonese style and suzhou style .
what's the difference between these two styles ?
the skin of cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts .
get me some of each .
why is there water all over the bathroom floor ?
i'm sorry - it's my fault . i was filling the bathtub and i left the water running too long , so it overflowed .
excuse me , i have something to trouble you .
yes ? i'll be very glad if i could be of any help to you .
an hour ago , i bought this vase with my tourist .
oh , yes . i remember it clearly . is there anything wrong with it ?
i'm afraid so . we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel .
oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ?
oh , it's quite all right , i suppose . it can't be helped sometimes .
it's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ?
all right . thank you .
just a minute , please . i won't be long . i'm sure this one is perfect . you may examine it carefully .
oh , yes , it is . i'll take this one .
i'm very sorry for any inconvenience i've caused you .
ann , it's terrible !
what's up ?
look , this is a pimple !
oh , i think it is .
how come ?
i think it's because of your bad habits !
i have no bad habit . i sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . i have done a lot .
i know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and i think this is your problem .
i wasn't aware of that !
you should do better later .
hello ? can you give me a tow ? my tour car's stranded .
sure . where are you ?
i'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 .
what kind of car ?
it's a blue nissan minivan .
where are you going to ?
the closest garage . what's the charge ?
you are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate .
how long will it take ?
about 20 to 30 minutes .
how's your new car ?
perfect ! couldn't be better .
you made a good choice , then ?
it's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i am glad you are happy .
it's super .
would you like to see our new shirts ?
sorry , but i'm not really that interested in those things .
well , they are very nice you know .
really ?
and not expensive either .
oh , i don't care about that .
everybody is buying them .
are they ?
yes , they are very fashionable , you see .
i am afraid i am not interested in fashion .
i see .
but thank you very much all the same .
tommy played truant today . his teacher called me this morning .
where did he go ?
i've asked him , but he won't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .
like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .
stop , stop ... we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
pay him ? but he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .
in that way , i'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
that's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ?
what is this big box at the front door ?
oh . i don't know what to do . i joined this club a long time ago and i didn't read the fine print .
what did you get yourself into ?
i didn't realize that i have to buy something from them every six months .
so , what's in the box ? a fridge ?
it's a curio cabinet . the only thing is i don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .
i guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you !
don't rub it in . where am i going to put this huge thing ?
what's up ? you sound a little down in dumps .
i quarreled with my roommate last night . he is really stubborn .
calm down ! shouting won ’ t help ?
he is really outrageous .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i couldn't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
what ? he can't do this to you .
well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
what did you do ?
i shouted it back of course .
hold it , mike . you won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
what would you do if you were in my shoes ?
just stay cool . you know . when you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .
no way , kate . i mean it's just not my fault .
i know . it wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate .
i am too angry to do that .
how can i help you ?
i'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend .
do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . 5 . but i'd like to buy her a new fragrance .
ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes .
which one would you recommend ?
personally , i quite like the new perfume from clinique . it's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ?
that smells great . i'll take one bottle , please .
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
it's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and i don't know what shade to buy .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
she doesn't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
no , thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is .
i know what she would like-some whitening cream .
no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .
will that be all then ?
that will be all . you've been very helpful , thanks .
good morning , madam . can i help you ?
i want to buy some cleansing milk . what would you recommend ?
your complexion is on the oily side . i suggest you use cleansing gel .
anything that can keep my skin clean will do .
how do you prefer this one ? it cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . the gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy .
hm ... the smell is too strong , i can't stand it . i'm very sensitive to fragrance .
we've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . i'm sure you'll like it .
i'll try that . do you have facial cream to go with that ?
yes , sure . this line of products is fragrance-free . we have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic .
i'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . if they suit me , i'll come back for the others later .
what did you buy at the market ?
i bought some special local products .
you seem to have bought the whole market !
yes . i really wanted to do so . i love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut .
paper-cuts are all hand-made . let me see the paper-cuts you bought . they are all animals .
aren't animals the main content of chinese paper-cuts ?
all right . animals , especially chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . but there are other themes .
then i will buy some tomorrow .
why do you want to buy so much ?
because i want to send them to my friends .
are there pets allowed in this apartment ?
no dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed .
what about a boa constrictor ?
well . . . is that a pet ? isn't that something from the zoo ?
if i had one , could i rent this apartment ?
i was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock .
what about a gila monster ?
i'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here .
dad , can i have a pet ? i did what you said and passed all of my exams .
then i guess you get to have a pet . do you know what you want ?
i want a dog . my friend mindy's dog just had puppies and she said i can have one .
you know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ?
i know , i know . i will do it all by myself .
have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ?
yes . it will cost me about $ 50 a month . and i make a little more than that already .
sounds like you've done your homework . i think you're ready for this .
beth , would you like me to help you carry it ?
thanks , but i don't want to put you into any trouble .
i think this painting would look good in our living room . what do you think ?
sure . let's buy it .
help ! i'm about to drop these books .
i've got them .
what can i do for you ?
i'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . could you make a recommendation for me ?
i'd like to . how do you like the hat ?
it's not special . it can be seen everywhere .
how about the umbrella ? it's made of wood and paper . it's very beautiful .
it's interesting . let me see .
do you like it ?
yes , how much is it ?
fifty yuan .
ok , i'll take it .
where are you going , tony ?
it's none of your business .
mom said you couldn't go out .
i'm going out anyway . get out of my way .
has someone already helped you ?
no , not yet . i'd like to buy a teapot .
which do you like best ?
that colored one is very beautiful . it may suit my furniture . how much do you ask for it ?
360 yuan .
show it to me , please . can you get me another ? it's scratched a little bit here .
sorry , sir . this is the last one we have in stock .
i do like it . can you come down a bit ?
i can give you a 10 % discount .
that's still too much . can you lower the price further ?
i'm afraid that's the best we can do .
if so , i'd better try another store .
so how far is the museum , dad ?
it is about 10 minutes walk .
finish your hot chocolate and we will go .
are we going to come back here for lunch ?
no , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria .
i have finished . we can go now .
let's go then . on the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction .
let's stop at the newsagent , i would like to buy a newspaper . we can also buy postcards for your friends .
can you see a post office somewhere around here ?
yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket .
i need some flowers for my girlfriend .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
oh , no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
how much did you want to spend ?
money is no object .
our most elegant flower is golden lily .
i will take ten .
do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? they are equally popular now .
of course . can i have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
what can i do for you ?
can i have a look at your handworks ?
all right . this way , please .
you have quite a range , haven't you ?
yes , sir .
they are all produced in china , aren't they ?
yes , they are all distinctive chinese .
could you please select me one ?
how do you like this one ? it's very beautiful .
oh , i like it very much . how much does it cost ?
350 yuan .
ok . i'll take it .
dad , do you know where mom is ?
i think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you .
she'd better not start crying like she usually does .
i know , but she is going to miss you something awful . have i told you how proud i am of you ?
dad , now don't you go getting mush on me .
i mean it . you have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world .
that means a lot to me dad . thanks .
we have great confidence in you .
mom , look ! my first piggy bank and it still has money in it !
that is a blast from the past .
remember when i used to beg you to break it so i could go buy ice cream ?
yes . you sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .
thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom .
but what are you going to do with that pig ?
i think i'm going to keep it as a monument to what i've learned about money .
who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top ceo in a major corporation !
tomorrow i will be the new owner of all dad's assets .
it still feels really strange to me .
i know . i miss him terribly .
how does it feel to be in charge of so much money ?
i thought i would feel like i was in the lap of luxury .
i guess you could choose that if you wanted .
no , i think i will run things much the same way that dad did .
dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone !
do i have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?
no , you do not have to . the handbag can be taken with you . there is the cart at the entrance .
thank you . i'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . is there anything that you can recommend for me ?
well , how old is your baby ?
no more than three .
the milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . i advice that you should buy the wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from new zealand .
how about its quality ?
you can be assured of it . there are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum .
ok , what is this ?
it is feeding-bottle as the free gift .
we will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . let's go to supermarket to buy some food .
yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill .
what should we buy ?
let me see . we should go to buy some fruit first .
it is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top .
how about taking a cantaloupe ? it is light and sweet . children love it .
good idea . we can buy some candy and nuts for children .
yes . look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ?
that's enough for the kids . get some drinks .
definitely beer . two bottles .
right . we should buy some yoghurt for kids .
yes . shall we buy some saucers ? it will be used during our picnic .
ok . four saucers . we can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning .
let's go to queue up . there are so many people in the lines .
can i help you ?
i need some stamps .
what kind of stamps do you want ?
how much do i need for this letter ?
i must weigh it .
how much ? is it overweight ?
it is 5 grams overweight . do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
how much is it , then ?
registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all .
ok . here you are .
hi barbara . have you lost weight ?
hi julie . yeah . i've been on a diet for a couple of months now .
wow . you look great .
thanks for noticing .
what type of diet were you on ?
i joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . with a combination of eating better and exercising , i managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .
that's amazing . what tips did your trainer give you ?
mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice i got was changing my eating habits . instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .
that doesn't make sense . if you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?
actually , i'm eating the same amount . i eat 5 smaller meals a day . basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .
that makes sense . i'm going to try that .
you don't need to lose weight .
i have a little gut i have been trying to get rid of .
ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .
thanks for the advice .
no problem .
nancy , please turn the tv down .
come on , john . this is my favorite show .
i'm sleepy . i can hardly keep my eyes open .
why don't you go to bed ?
nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . do you know why ?
i think he hasn't made any new friends yet . he's just a little lonely .
he really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .
without a doubt . maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him .
how do you propose to help him understand that ?
well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends .
i guess we could go visit once in a while too .
yeah . there's a lot we can do to help him through this transition .
oops !
what happened ?
i overcooked the corn .
that's okay . i like it better that way anyway .
i'm freezing . turn down the air conditioner , will you ?
but then it'll be too warm .
hi , i'm home ! can you double that recipe ? i ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner .
no problem . who is it ? anyone i know ?
i don't think so . do you remember bob gain from tulsa ?
that name doesn't ring a bell . but tell me more .
he was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .
well , i'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake .
you're glad he saved me , huh ?
absolutely ! bob and his whole family are welcome here any time !
can you believe her ? she is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .
tell me about it . if i was as small as her , i wouldn't think about going on a diet .
me too . but what are we going to do ? i have been on 4 different diets and i can't seem to lose weight .
that's because you don't exercise . if you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .
what do you know ? you are over weight too .
i'm not on a diet though .
i know . but i don't have someone to diet with . if we help each other and motivate each other , then i think we can lose some weight .
i like ice cream too much though .
c'mon . you'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .
it does sound appealing .
it's a great idea . i can't believe i didn't think of this earlier . going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .
okay . i'm in . let's do it .
great . i'll get our plan started right away .
can we start tomorrow though ?

good afternoon , sir . gan i help you ?
good afternoon , i want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired .
which brand are you interested in ?
i'm still not sure . the type with top quality , i guess . well , which one do you recommend ?
do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ?
it doesn't matter much . if it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be ok .
how about flymo ? it's selling well .
do you have a warranty on it ?
of course . the warranty period is one year .
if there's something wrong with it in a week , can i come back to change it ?

let's get a shopping cart .
good idea
what are you going to buy ?
let's check out the fruit section first .

my mom and dad insist that i be home before ten . do you have a curfew ?
yes . i've had one for as long as i can remember .
i wish my parents were a little more lenient .
i actually like having a curfew . i have an excuse to get to bed on time .
you like going to bed early ?
i don't like being too tired the next day .
well , i still hate having a curfew .
if you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway .
i found a great school for junior !
don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? we haven't even had the baby yet !
we can't be too cautious about these things .
you are going to be such an adorable father ! tell me about this school .
there is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook !
what about inside the school ?
there is a library right inside the front door .
i think our child is going to love it !
what do you think about half day kindergarten for stacey ?
we could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it .
i just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat .
you have a good point . she hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours .
i think she is really going to like her teacher though .
yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day .
did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ?
no , but i did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies !
tom , it's time for you to take a shower .

i want a haircut just like that kind .
i want to ask you for a favor . i want to rent an apartment here in beijing , but as a foreigner , i don't know the normal practice . can you give me some advice ?
first , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . then i can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you .
i am a student and want to live in haitian , so that i can live close to my school . i like to play soccer and i like a quiet apartment so i can study .
i think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . i can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . the apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying .
that sounds great !
you can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some chinese friends there . it is right near the market and has comfortable facilities .

it ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; i ’ d rather run in the morning .
well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? i ’ ll stop by your house on my way out .
i could try , but i can ’ t say for sure if i ’ ll get up in time . what time do you want to go ?
i ’ ll give you a call around 6:00 and stop by around 6:30 .
o . k . , maybe if i have someone to go with , i ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog .
great , i ’ ll see you then .
all i do all day is work and watch tv . i really should start thinking about my health .
i never thought about that , but you're right . what do you think we should do ?
for starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . that way we'll get some exercise .
i was thinking about taking tennis lessons . i always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . what do you think about that ?
that's not a bad idea . how much is it ?
i heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons .
hey michael . where are you going ?
no where special . i was just taking a walk .
what for ?
to get a little exercise . i'm so out of shape .
hey , i play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . it's great exercise and it's fun too . why don't you come out and play with us ?
that sounds great . give me a call next time you guys play .
all i do all day is work and watch tv . i really should start thinking about my health .
i never thought about that , but you're right . what do you think we should do ?
for starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . that way we'll get some exercise .
i was thinking about taking tennis lessons . i always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . what do you think about that ?
that's not a bad idea . how much is it ?
i heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons .
one of my students told me she was very depressed today .
why ?
her father is dying .
oh , that ’ s very sad .
yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid .
what did you do ?
i talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . so , i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
that ’ s a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things .
yeah , that ’ s what i told her . i ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own .
yeah , me too .
have you seen the movie batwoman ?
no , not yet . is it good ?
yes , it's quite amusing , actually . good plot , and sharon stone's in it .
oh , she's good . she must be getting on a bit now .
yeah , but she looks amazing .
so what's the movie about ?
well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . but then she got reincarnated as a cat .
huh ?
i know . stay with me . she then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . first , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . at the end she had a big fight with sharon stone , who was the real danger in the company . she had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought batwoman was evil .
i see . batwoman married the boss ?
no . sharon stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . so where was i ? ok , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature .
wait a minute , i'm lost . the cop killed the boss ?
no , sharon stone did .
and sharon stone is batwoman ?
hi mike . what have you been up to ?
not much . i started exercising .
trying to get in shape ?
yeah , and i need to start improving my health .
me too . what are you doing besides exercising ?
that's about all .
i think if you eat better , it will help tremendously .
sleep is good too . i heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems .
looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy .
true . but i think it is worth it . when you get old , you want to be healthy and active .
yes , i think there is something wrong with my car .
what's the matter ?
when i tried to back it , i found it was out of order . i can't see where the trouble is .
let me see .
is it serious ?
no , the damage is minor .
and when will it be ok ?
4:00 p . m ..
mike , i'm afraid i can't come back home for dinner tonight .
not back home for dinner again ? that's the third time this week !
i'm sorry . our company has just opened . there are always too many things to handle . you know that .
you don't have to explain . suit yourself .
please forgive me . you have my word . i'll spend some time with you on the weekend . i promise .
we'll see .

yes , i'd like to get some gas .
regular or unleaded ?
unleaded . my car is new .

you're a quart low .
give me a quart of light oil .
damn scott . you got big .
yeah , i've been working out a lot .
how long have you been lifting weights ?
for a year and a half .
yeah . last time i saw you , it was like 2 years ago .
has it been that long ?
how often do you go to the gym ?
i usually go every other day for about 3 hours .
that's a lot .
yeah , i used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week , and i saw no results . this is what you have to do to get noticeable results .
i don't think i have the discipline for that .
just think of it as a hobby . then it's actually fun .
what do you do besides work and watching tv ?
when i have some time , i like to exercise .
do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ?
i joined samsung health club a couple of months ago .
how do you exercise ?
i usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the carpio , and then i lift weight for about 45 minutes .
how often do you go ?
i want to go four times a week , but i'm too lazy . last week , i only went to workout once .
what can i do for you ?
i want to get my car washed .
would you like regular car wash package ?
i don't know what you mean .
well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . we use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine .
do you wash windows ?
of course . we wash the windows inside and out .
what about the interior ?
we use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find .
sounds good , regular car wash package will be ok .
this looks wonderful , madame culot .
yes , it's very nice . all our foreign visitors enjoy it . the food is wonderfully well-prepared . let me know if you need any help with the menu .
thank you . mmm . can you tell me about the terrine ?
yes . a terrine is a kind of meat pate . it's meat turned into a paste . it sounds horrible but it's actually really good .
mmm . maybe another time .
you could try the ravioli . they are rather like your chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
sounds good . i think i'll have the lamb for my main course . what does it come with ?
well , you can have fries-french fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
i'll have the potatoes . what are you having ?
i'm having my usual . i like the fish here . would you like some wine ?

a tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car .

they're saying it was already there .
what the hell . that doesn't make sense . what are you going to do ?
i have to go to court . a cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there .
that sucks . i'd be pissed if that happened to me .
i got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars .
oh my gosh . damn ... screw the court , i would burn down their store .
we'll see what happens after court .

you can do some jogging . it's easy and it doesn't take much time .
actually , my doctor said the same thing .
do you know where i can find old music boxes ?

here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir .
thank you . it looks very attractive .
i would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot .
tasty and tender ! it must be one of the famous local dishes .
yes . it's a traditional dish .
and it must be very particular in cooking .
you are right , sir . to prepare it , a sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . that's why the dish has a bright colour .
i see .
what kind of cuisine do you have ?
we have sichuan food , hangzhou food and beijing food . which do you like best ?
hangzhou food .
ok . how about dongpo meat ?
all right . i'll take it .
do you like to use chopsticks
yes , i like using chopsticks .
do you like some soup ?
yes , but i don't know what soup you have .
we have beef soup and tomato soup .
good . i prefer beef soup .
according to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . if you like we'll bring you some soup first .
save it until you've served dishes .
all right . i'll be back right away .
taxi .
yes , sir , where are you going ?
i am going to the railway station .
get on , please .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
i am not sure , sir . generally we can , but look at the traffic . it's the rush hour .
my train will leave at 3:00 , i'll have to arrive there before 2:50 .
we are really in a hurry .
can't we go faster ?
i'll do my best .
can you show me how to use chopsticks ?
with pleasure .
oh , it is not easy to learn !
i think you are a quick learner .
well , i don't think i can manage with it .
in that case , shall i ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ?
may i help you ?
is this the right counter for gloves ?
yes , madam . what sort of gloves do you want ?
well , let me see some of each .
certainly . what size do you take ?
six and a quarter , i believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure .
i think a six is your size . how do you like these ? i can recommend them , they're very reliable .
very well , i'll take these two .
may i take your order now ?
yes , i'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please .
how would you like your eggs ?
hard-boiled , please .
and your toast , light or dark ?
dark , please .
now or later ?
later will do .
will there be anything else ?
no , that's all . thanks .
one hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow .
that's right .
may i have a reservation ?
yes , of course .
i've got three guests today . we'd like a table next to the window .
all right . your name , please .
i'm chen liang .
chen liang , a table for four . and when are you coming ?
we may come at 6:30 p . m .
ok . we look forward to seeing you . goodbye .
what are you doing ?
i'm watching tv .
are there any good programs on tv ?
tingling is on tv .
which channel is it ?
channel 8 .
i think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls .
why ? it doesn't make sense . if we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor .
hmm maybe you're right . but i can't stand all this green carpet here . and besides , i know how to paint . i will just cover everything with drop cloth . i won't get anything on the floor .
are you sure ?
yes , i'm sure i've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
alright . then maybe we can do the floor first . these wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . and me too — — i can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . but how can we get it out ? do we have to hire someone ?
absolutely not . we can remove the carpet ourselves . carpet is held down with carpet nails . you just need to pull it hard and it will come up .
great . then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . right ?
yes . but we should hire someone for that . that will probably be expensive . and it has to be done right .
and then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in .
hello , is that the peace restaurant ?
yes . may i help you ?
yes . i'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . can you arrange it for us ?
just a minute . i'll check if there is any availability . i'm sorry , sir . there isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . would you like to make a reservation at that time ?
let me see . it seems a little late .
usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time .
ok . i'll change the time to 8: 00 .
very good , sir . a table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . may i have your name , please ?
it's john .
thank you very much . bye .
do you live in the red house at the end of the road ?
yes , i live in that house with my parents and my sister .
we also have a cat and a dog .
do you take your dog for a walk every day ?
no . my father takes the dog for a walk every monday , tuesday and sunday .
and i take the dog for a walk every wednesday , thursday and friday .
who takes the dog on saturday ?
on saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us .
do you help with the housework ?
my mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but i clean my room .
you're right . watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . i like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast .
i agree . and it's very convenient .
have you ever heard of a movie rental company called netflix ? they send the movies directly to your house in the mail .
really ? that's great ! i'm going to try that next time .
good evening , saliva . what's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? what are you doing now ?
i am cooking now !
are you good at cooking ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant , so i have to practise cooking !
it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? !
i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ?
yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well-done and too salty .
that's the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
i have the same idea as yours .
it's ok . please have a taste of it .
thank you . oh , it's very delicious .
thank you for your praise .
besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
i am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .
so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ?
why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
thanks a lot .
it's my pleasure .
alright , tell me what you think about this one .
don't you think it's a bit bright ?
yeah , maybe you're right . how about this outfit ?
that dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?
no , i don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just want to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it's casual , yet sophisticated .
i like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . it's too plain on its own .
how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
that's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
thanks . you'd be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ?
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that looks great . just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
can i borrow this magazine from you ? it's really interesting and i can't put it down .
i am sorry , but i can't lend it to you now , for i haven't finished reading it . if you don't mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you .
that would be very kind of you . by the way , is it a monthly magazine ?
no , it is a fortnightly . so , you see , i can get the new one quite soon .
boy , come here !
yes , sir ! what can i do for you ?
bring me a cup of coffee , please .
will you have it strong or weak ?
won't you have some of this ?
yes , thanks .
it's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .
it's very good . how do you make it ?
i use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
this salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
i'm glad you like it .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
oh , but chinese food is so delicious . i wish i knew how to cook chinese food . do you follow recipes ?
we use different spices but few people use recipes . they learn to cook by experience .
here , let me get the door for you .
thanks .
do you need a hand with that ?
actually , i could use some help . thank you so much .
doctor , my child is nine years old , and i recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school .
is he doing very well at school ?
he is doing ok , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies .
what's his problem ?
this may be complicated . but i think he may need to build up his self-esteem .
how can his he do that ?
nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
what you said is true . but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . for example , to make more movie ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean i no longer see films ; instead , i see films at home-watching ccds .
there are many new kinds of newspapers . i find it hard to choose among them . which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?
i'd recommend you the morning paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper .
what's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?
i think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . it also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . many people are now speculating in the stock market .
good morning , mrs . smith .
good morning ! can you help me , please ? i'm looking for some books for my mother .
what kind of books does she like ?
she's very fond of detective stories .
jim ? jim ? ... what are you doing in the kitchen ?
nothing , mummy . i was hungry so i came here for some milk .
milk ? i thought you didn't like milk .
i don't , but i couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
nonsense . there's lots of food in the refrigerator ... what's behind your back ?
nothing .
what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see .
promise that you won't get angry .
ok , i promise . what is it ?
it's a kitty .
oh , jim . i told you . no pets . it'll make a mess of this house .
please , mummy . everybody else in my class keeps a pet . please , i'll take care of it . it's a good kitty . it'll not bring you any trouble .
no way . it might belong to somebody else . you can't keep it here .
please , mummy . i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . it was starving and looking for something to eat . please ! you see , it's so cute and tame .
all right . but you have to clean up everything it messes up .
i will . thank you , mummy .
there are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . but only a few of them are influential world-wide .
you have hit the point . it's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds .
but i think digest is supposed to be the top one . its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . it's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .
to my mind , the success of digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue .
hello , do you have any vacancies ?
yes , something just opened up .
what kind of apartment is it ?
it's a one-bedroom , one-bathroom apartment .
what kind of films do you like best ?
i like feature films best . how about you ?
i don't like feature films . i think sometimes it loses contact with reality . i like to see some documentary films . what kind of feature films do you like best ?
i always like to see the oldies , like the sound of music , gone with the wind . they are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot .
hello ?
hi , is heather there please ?
sorry , i think you have the wrong number .
is this 617-228-2289 ?
yes . who are you looking for again ?
heather johnson .
oh , i thought you said laura . sorry about that . this is the right number , but heather's not here right now .
do you know where she went ?
she went to the store to buy some groceries . would you like to leave a message ?
yes , would you please tell her eric martin called ?
hi eric , this is her roommate kathy . i met you a couple months ago at the christmas party .
oh , yes . how are you ?
good . heather will be back in about 20 minutes . i'll tell her you called .
ok . thanks .
i saw your ad in the new york times . i am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .
we are happy to help you . may i know which one it is ?
the two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street .
oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ?
that's why i think it may suit my needs .
i believe it will . it comes furnished . you can move in immediately after the lease is signed .
the ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . is it true ?
yes . but not including the utilities .
will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ?
i believe that can be arranged . but there should be a refundable security deposit , you know .
how much is the rent ?
the rent is $ 1500 per month .
and how much is the deposit ?
the deposit is $ 500 .
mmm ... it is delicious .
oh , do you really like it ?
yes . it's superb .
well , it's kind of you to say so .
in fact , could i ask you for the recipe ?
sure . it's really very easy . first , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . then , add two ounces of milk . are you with me ?
yes , i've got it .
ok . next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .
wait a minute . i didn't catch you there . could you repeat that ?
sure . bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .
hello , who's that speaking ?
i am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . do you still have it now ?
yes , i do .
is there any furniture in it ?
yes , it's fully furnished .
what's the rent for a year ?
15,000 yuan , including water , but electricity and gas .
where is it located ?
it's in international trade zone . it's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station .
that's great . but can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 yuan ?
the price can be talked over . how about coming around and taking a look at it first ?
ok . i will be free at tomorrow afternoon . i'll take a taxi to get there .
hey sarah , i'm having some trouble finding an apartment . can you help me look at some listings online ?
sure . what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
well , it has to be cheap . i don't want a really expensive apartment .
ok . would you like to live in a studio ?
jeff , look at this listing ! it says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . what do you think ?
well i think i can afford that apartment . but are pets allowed ?
hmm ... let me look . yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
that's great . that means i can bring my cat , mr . twinkles . where is the apartment located ?
well , this apartment is really a must-see . will you come with me to look at it this weekend ?
sure . and if you rent it , maybe i can help you find a roommate too .
great ! do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ?
yes , my friend steve . i'll introduce you .
it's located in the suburbs ? well even though that sounds like a steal , i really want something downtown .
ok . well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .
i know , that's my problem . what do you think i should do ?
well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .
well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? the listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro .
wow , that would be very convenient . how much is the rent ?
it says it's $ 1600 . but if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month .
that definitely sounds like a steal . i think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well .
i'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised .
yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . and they are all newly renovated .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown , as i spend most of my time at the office .
no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
i'm sure it is wonderful , but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find the right apartment there .
great ! i'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed address ?
of course . it's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .
good evening , yanking restaurant .
could i reserve a table for saturday , september 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ?
certainly , sir . for how many people , please ?
for two people . we would like a quiet table , please .
of course . may i have your name , please ?
this is mr . william .
can you spell that , please ?
william . w-i-l-l-i-a-m .
a friend told me i might find a room here .
yes . i'll have a room free next week .
what do you charge ?
12,000 a year , but you can't get visitors to live in .
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
could you come back later ? we're right in the middle of dinner .
i'd like to reserve a table for three this evening .
just a moment , sir . let me check the reservation list . sorry , i'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . would you like to make a reservation some other time ?
do you have pot service at noon ?
yes , the same service and food as in the evening .
ok , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow .
ok . your name , please ?
black .
good . thank you very much .
can you show me some jade , please ?
yes , of course . do you like a jade necklace ?
no , but i do like jade bracelets .
here are all kinds of jades . choose whatever you like , please .
thank you . ( a moment later ) oh , this one is quite impressive . i'll take it . by the way , do you sell pearl earrings ?
yes . natural pearls or cultured pearls ? we have both kinds .
i wonder which looks more lustrous .
well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful .
do you take in students ? i've been told you might have a vacant room .
yes . if you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available .
how much are you asking ?
800 yuan a month .
could i have a look at it , please ?
sorry , but i'm on my way out now . could you come back in an hour ?
i'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . do i have to pay in cash ?
no , we have an easy-payment plan . one-third down , and the balance in six months .
fine . will you work out the details , please ?
certainly . would you sit here please ? i'll call our credit manager .
thank you .
it's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references .
what kind of references do you need ?
perhaps your employer could supply us with one .
i'm sure he could , but i prefer not to bother him . would my bank do ?
certainly . a simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory .
when can i see the one-bedroom apartment ?
there's an open house this weekend .
what time does the open house start ?
it starts at 11am in the morning .
i wonder if you can help me . i'm looking for a room .
yes . i've got a small room .
how much is it ?
200 yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed .
ok . can i see the room now ?
would you mind waiting ? i'm on the telephone .
mmmm ... this apartment seems a little expensive . do you have any cheap studios ?
actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now .
do you think any studios will open up soon ?
no , not for a few months .
what kind of lease is it ?
it's a one-year lease .
can i have a month-to-month lease ? i only want to rent the apartment for five months .
no , all the leases are for one year . we don't have month-to-month leases .
well , then i don't think this would be a good apartment for me . thank you anyway .
you're welcome .
are utilities included in the rent ?
gas and water are included .
do i have to pay for electricity myself ?
yes , electricity is not included in the rent .
excuse me , how do i get to the grand hotel ?
i am sorry , i didn ’ t catch what you said . could you repeat it please ?
the grand hotel , is it far from here ?
sorry , my english isn ’ t so good . could you speak a little slower ?
what games do you like ?
i like word games .
how about a game of bridge ?
i don't like it at all .
what about guessing games ?
i'm not one for the games .
let's play other game .
what about playing go ?
excuse me , you look lost . can i help you ?
oh , thank you . i'm looking for the train station .
right . let me see . you go straight down here and turn right .
right ? ok , got it .
then take the next left then the next right . are you with me ?
next left then right ? ok .
miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ?
sure , why not ?
this is a new product of company this year . it's oil-free .
i see . it feels very light on the skin .
it gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
i like the cool smell , too .
what's the problem , sir ?
i bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . my son played with it only twice and it broke .
do you keep the receipt ?
yes , and i have the warranty , too .
what do you want me to do about it ?
i'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can .
this way , please . we've got a nice private for you .
that's good . thank you .
here we are . i hope you will like it .
it's good . it's a nice room .

i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ?
do you want to buy a new bicycle ?
yes , and they have a sale on now .
what happened to your old one ?
i left it at my parent's house , but i need one here as well .
i've been using jim's old bike but he needs it back .
let's go then .
look at this mountain bike . it is only £ 330 . do you like it ?
i prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive .
how much is it ?
the price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount .
ok , let's go and ask .
i'd like to taste some local dishes . what would you recommend ?
that's fine . you must try this dish .
could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
it's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .

yes .
would you like an appetizer ?
yes . i'd like a crab cocktail .
would you like some soup first ?
very well .
what kind of soup would you like ?
i want egg soup .
have you decided on anything ?
i'd like to have some meat .

no , thank you .
are you interested in today's special ?
what is it ?
twice cooked spicy pork slices .
ok . let me try it .
anything else ?
no , thank you
the car isn't running smoothly . i'd like to have a look at it .
what's the matter with it ?
i'm not sure . it could be the tires . let's stop here .
how about the tires ?
excuse me , do you know where the post office is ?
yes , it's not very far from here . follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . you will see a small restaurant at the corner .
is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ?
it is on the right . but it is on the other side of the lights .
ok . do i turn on the lights or do i go straight ?
you go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right .
and do i take that road ?
yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . you will see the post office on your left .
is there a post office sign on the building ?
yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . there is also a small supermarket next to it .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ?
no , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man .
i'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . i noticed that most chess players were bald .
that's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald .
may i take your order now ?
yes , please . what's special today ? any special recommendations ?
certainly . i would recommend ' songshuguiyu ' .
the name sounds fascinating . what is it exactly ?
well , it is sweet and sour fried mandarin fish .
sorry , i'm not interested in vinegar .
then , how about this one ?
ok . i'll have that .
very good . could i serve you anything else ?
thank you . that's enough .
my pleasure . just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . please enjoy your lunch .
thanks .
let's see . i had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my pizza was £ 8.25 .
i had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 .
so that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you .
yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ?
yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us .
so now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and i need to pay £ 22.50 .
and i had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . and you had coffee which is £ 2 .
and is that all ?
yes , this is everything on the list .
so now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . is that correct ?
yes , that's exactly it . how much tip shall we give the waiter ?
i think £ 5 would be good .
good evening .
good evening . we've a reservation for a table for four . my name is tim .
let me check the list . yes , we do have a reservation under mr . tim .
but there is a change in the number of people . there are seven of us . three of my friends are coming soon .
it doesn't matter . follow me , please . what do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?
well , it's a window table that we've booked .
i'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .
oh , i see . we'll have to make up with the center one .
thank you for your understanding , mr . tim .
if a mr . wu comes to look for me , just take him here .
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
we should plan to move out of here before july . i'm tired of living in apartments .
i know , dear . i am too . but we've just been too busy to look for a house .
we need to find a good realtor .
not necessary . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
what do you mean ?
realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
but doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
yes , that's often true . but you have to pay them .
i still think we should have a realtor . we're new in this country . we don't know all the laws of buying a house . and also , the realtor will inspect the house . he can tell us if the house has any problems .
of course we need a house inspector . but we can hire an inspector on our own . as for the legal problems , i have friends . they can help us .
so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
and doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
why ?
that is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . he will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
hmm . it all sounds very complicated .
it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time . that's why we haven't done it yet . it's very troublesome .
i want to look in the papers today . maybe we can see something we like .
where to , madam ?
grand central station , please . i want to catch a 6 p . m . train .
i think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam .
here is the grand central station .
thank you . how much is the fare ?
the meter reads 9.15 dollars .
here you are . keep the change .
thank you .
good evening , sir . welcome to our restaurant .
thank you .
do you have a reservation ?
yes , i do .
may i have your name , please ?
yes , it's mr . brown .
mr . brown . we were expecting you . this way , please . will this table be fine ?
oh , this is just fine .
please take a seat .
thank you .
would you like to have a piece of cake ?
no , thank you . i'm on a diet .
why ? you're not fat .
i'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so i must have a slender figure .
women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident .
i'm afraid the judges do not think so . all the beauty contests are for slim girls only .
well . there's a beauty contest in thailand just for fat beauties .
how much do they weigh ?
all the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg .
but i'm not fat enough to enter that contest .
excuse me . could you tell me the way to the star hotel ?
yes . go down the main road . you can't miss it .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it's only about a five-minute walk .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
where to , sir .
to this place , please .
star hotel . ok .
how long does it take to get to the hotel ?
about 20 minutes .
here's the hotel .
how much is the fare ?
that's 10 dollars .
good morning , madam . i think i'm lost here . the place i want to go to is a hotel called the hilton .
do you know in which area ?
no , i am sorry i have no idea . i am a stranger here .
i see . well , do you know anything near the hotel ?
oh , yes . my friend told me the hotel was near the central railway station .
then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the central railway station .
can you show me where the central railway station is on this map ?
ok .
hello , are you interested in this honda ?
hi , i am just looking .
it's a good car .
what year is it ?
1999 .
how about the mileage ?
6,000 miles , all highway mileage .
what do you mean 7b
highway miles are not as bad as local miles . they do not hurt car as much .
oh , why such a high mileage ?
the owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line .
okay . does this car have a warranty ?
one month .
how do i make sure i am not buying a junk ?
you'll check it out anyway you want . you can take it to a garage .
how much is it ?
$ 5,900 .
i'll have to think about it .
leave your phone number , and i will give you a call if the price gets reduced .
okay .
what else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ?
we need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings .
i'm the painter . you can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . that will probably be pretty expensive too . having good curtains made isn't cheap .
you mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?
absolutely not . the windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . so that will take a while . maybe a month or so .
while the curtains are being made , i can start having people look at the kitchen . i can't stand that old kitchen . i won't be able to cook there . i don't want to use that electric stove .
we need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . i believe in portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . i will look in the yellow pages . i'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green .
i agree . the colors must be soft and pleasant . you should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners .
me ? cook our dinners ? hah ! you will be cooking , dear . you will cook .
no , i don't think so . i'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room .
well , i suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . so you won't be able to afford any clothes next year .
and you'll have to sell your motorcycle . and your cameras . right ?
maybe i'll cook once or twice a week . how is that ?
four times might be enough . not once or twice .
hi , mike . i am going to move on the first of next month .
congratulations ! so , have you started planning your move ?
yes , i am trying to find good movers now . do you know any ?
not really .
what did you do for your last move ?
since i did not have much staff , i asked my cousin to help me out .
oh . that's very nice of him .
yeah , it was . but i still have some information that i collected last time , and if you want , i will give it to you .
miss , may i help you ?
yes , i just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different .
it's because of the view .
oh ! i see . can you show me the location of block i ?
sure . please take a look at the model of the building . nice garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled block i and block ii . block i has a total of thirty-eighth floors . the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . there are four units in one floor . the sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . the size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .
how many elevators are there ?
there are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units .
how about the car-park space ?
there are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents .
any other facilities ?
sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . there are two swimming pools . one is olympic standard size and the other one is for children . also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .
what is the completion date ?
the completion date will be july 1st 2007 .
how about the price and the bank mortgage ?
please check up the price list . the average unit price is five million hong kong dollars . there are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers .
how many payment methods are there ?
it's all written on the brochure price list . i believe there will be one right for you . please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .
thank you . i think i have to talk to the bank representatives . thank you for your help .
you know , i'm a pretty laid-back person . i don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . for example , i like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal .
i totally agree . i really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and i don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . my last roommate was a drama queen . every time i forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .
yeah , i really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . it's important that we don't get on each other's nerves .
that's right . we should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another .
excuse me , could you tell me which bus i should take to go to the railway station ?
i think you'd better take the no . 16 bus . it can take you right there .
how often dose this bus go there ?
every fifteen minutes .
i really can't wait that long . are there any other buses that can take me there ?
the no . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . you may take it .
where can i find the bus ?
the bus stop is not far from here . go straight on and you can easily find it .
thanks a lot .
you are welcome .
good morning , madam . what can i do for you ? !
i'd like a coffee please .
certainly , madam . what kind of coffee would you like ?
what have you got ?
well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and americano .
goodness me ! so many choices ! i think i'll have a cappuccino please .
hi steve , it's nice to meet you . i hear that you're looking for an apartment , and i just rented a two-bedroom downtown . i'm looking for a compatible roommate .
great , i'm looking for a place right in that area . your apartment sounds ideal .
alright . so tell me , how would you describe yourself ?
i'm pretty social and outgoing , and i like making new friends . but i'm not a party animal , and i like to keep the apartment clean .
what is your favorite coffee ?
irish coffee is my favorite . but i'm not particular on it .
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
not very often . making coffee is a bit troublesome . most of the time , i just buy takeout at starbucks . and also , i quite like instant coffee .
i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .
exactly . nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world .
i agree . i heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . is that true ?
yes . no doubt about that . for us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people don't drink that much coffee .
no , we don't , especially the elder people . but more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .
i suppose so . that's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in china now .
excuse me , is this where i can catch a bus to the museum ?
yes , you're at the right stop .
thank you .
are you new here ?
yes .
have you got small change ? they require exact fare .
yes , i've got some coins . how much is the fare ?
one yuan . when you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box .
i see . how often does this bus run at this time of day ?
it runs every ten minutes . oh , here comes the bus .
may i know where you are going ?
yes . i want to go to beijing hotel .
i'm sorry . you are going in the wrong direction .
oh no ! what shall i do ?
don't worry . you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . the bus stop is right there .
thank you very much .
here we are on the train .
yes , we are travelling at rush hours . it could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon .
i hear many people have cars .
yes , almost all the families have their own cars .
why don't they drive ? isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?
well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown .
good coming , sir .
good morning .
would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ?
of course not . but i don't know when to get off .
where are you going ?
i'm going to wangfujing .
don't worry . i'll let you know when we get there .
thank you very much .
how much is the fare ?
three yuan .
could you tell me how to use it ?
you put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .
oh , i see . by the way , how can i get out of the platform after i get off the train ?
that's very easy . the exit is always open .
thank you for your help .
my pleasure .
may i try on this pair of shoes ?
of course . what is your size ?
i think it's 35 .
ok . i'll get it for you .
hmm , i don't feel very comfortable .
try this one , please . this is made of real leather and is very soft . how is it ?
can i see some men's watches ?
of course . how about this one ?
what functions does this watch have ?
it's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function .
is it waterproof ?
yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee .
let's go to the cinema by bus .
better take the subway . it's far quicker and more convenient .
ok , it will be a new experience for me .
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
where do we pay the fare ?
just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket .
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
no , you don't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
may i help you , sir ?
i'd like to buy a shirt .
what color do you want ?
i prefer the blue one .
what size are you ?
i'm not sure . could you measure me , please ?
no problem . i think 40 will be fine for you .
can i try it on ?
would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
is this the one you want ?
no , the one next to it .
here you are .
thanks . what kind of stone is this ?
it's a ruby . it is from south africa . would you like to try it on ?
yes , please . how much is it ?
it costs $ 200 .
let's have a look at the map first .
all right . wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
let's buy some tickets .
the train is coming . there are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
no , but it will be soon . look , there're two empty seats over there . let's get them .
what would you have ?
i'll try chinese wine .
what about this dry red ? it's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
ok . give me one , please .
here it is .
thank you .
may i recommend you tsingtao beer ?
tsingtao beer ?
yes , sir . it's one of the best beers in china .
really ?
yes . the beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the lao mountain .
how about its taste ?
fine , sir .
that sounds great . two tsingtao beers , please .
tin or bottle ?
tin , please .
would you like it on the rocks , sir ?
no , thank you .
welcome !
would you give me a bottle of beer , please ?
with ice , sir ?
no , ice will spoil the taste .
anything else , sir ?
yes . something non-alcoholic , please .
fruit juice , milk or mineral water ?
a glass of juice please .
i'd like to reserve a table for two , please .
for what time , sir ?
around 8: 30 p . m .
may i have your name please , sir ?
yes , anthony fox .
mr . fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 .

master card . here you go .
wait a moment , please .
good afternoon , sir . can i help you ?
i'd like a beef-burger , a french fries and a milk shake , please .
what flavor would you prefer , sir ?
i'm not quite sure . what do you have ?
we have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana .
very well , i'll try the banana flavor .
anything else , sir ?
no , thanks . that will be all .
i like the honda accord you showed me before . i think it's more practical for my needs .
alright , sir . you are making a good choice . honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new accord .
what does it come with standard ?
on all our new cars , the standards include
cruise control ? i don't like that .
why not , sir ?
i think it's dangerous . what if i can't turn it off ?
well , sir , i know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . but honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .
i wish it didn't have cruise control . my wife doesn't like it either .
you know , sir , you don't have to use it . you can turn it on or off . if you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .
i suppose . and what about the sunroof ? is that standard ?
no , the sunroof is optional , sir .
for me , now an important question to buy an accord is the time when i can get this car . i need a new car rather soon .
well , i can say that the new models will be here in august . if you order one now , we will have it for you in august .
that's good enough , i think . what colors does the new accord come in ?
we have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . these are the standard colors . of course you could specially order from various other colors too .
my brother has last year's accord . and his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . i really like that color . i wonder if i can get that color on my accord .
i know the color you mean . is this it , sir ?
yes , i think that's it . can i get that on the accord ?
yes , you can . that color is very popular with honda buyers . so we've kept it available .
well , i think i want to order the new accord then . it looks like an excellent car .
you have made a good choice , sir . i drive an accord myself . they are very solidly built machines , very reliable .
yes , i know . i think honda is the most reliable car on the road . i would never change to anything else . the honda i have now almost never has service problems . it runs smooth as silk .
alright , sir . i will get the paperwork ready for you . just a moment .
would you please recommend some chinese wine ?
would you like to have a taste of moutan ?
that's great ! what comes along with moutan ?
yes , you con order some typical chinese dishes . for example , roast beijing duck .
it sounds good .
yes , it is the best of our hotel .
really ? let me have a try .
thank you . just a moment , please .
hello , how are you ? i am jack .
hello , i am amy .
what brings you here ?
i saw that your corollas are on sale .
yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . i've never seen a sale as good as this one .
tell me about corollas .
sure . it has 1.8 liter engine . this one comes with all power options , air condition , cd player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and abc . the window price is $ 17,000 , and i can give you for $ 16.000 .

you must be kidding ! you cannot get that price anywhere .
i am serious . $ 15,000 .

we'd like some local-flavored pastry . can you recommend some ?
how about some zongzi ?
what is that ?
well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves .
that sounds appealing . ok , we will have that .
do you want some stuffed bun ? it's delicious , too .
ok . we will try some .
anything else ?
no , it's enough .
ok . wait for a moment , please . i'll be back in a moment with the dishes .
may i take your order ?
we'd like this course for two , please .
i'm afraid this course is for four persons .
well , can't you make it for two only ?
i'm afraid not , sir .
i see . well , what do you recommend then ?
i would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes .
right , we'll have these three .
would you like rice with your meal ?
no , thanks .
are you ready to order now , sir ?
yes .
would you like an appetizer ?
yes . i'd like a crab cocktail .
would you like some soup first ?
very well .
what kind of soup would you like ?
i want egg soup .
have you decided on anything ?
i'd like to have some meat .
how about stewed-fried steamed pork ?
no , thank you .
are you interested in today's special ?
what is it ?
twice cooked spicy pork slices .
ok . let me try it .
anything else ?
no , thank you
would you show us the menu ?
sure . here you are .
i'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , i'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards .
sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . why don't you try it today ?
it sounds good . i'll try it .
would you like to have a drink ?
well , i'll have a glass of mineral water .
anything else ?
no , thank you . i think it's enough for dinner .
ok . i'll be back soon .
is there a car park near the supermarket ?
yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
hello , can i help you ?
yes , my engine warning light is on .
how long has it been on for ?
just since today .
you can still drive , without problems .
it runs fine .
let's check it out . there'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . if you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair .
okay .
please write down your address and phone number , and sign here .
okay .
it'll be about an hour . are you going to wait ?
no , you can give a call when you have done checking .
can i help you ?
yes , my brakes are not working well .
what's wrong with them ?
i hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake .
the front brake ?
i think so .
what kind of car is it ?
toyota corolla 2002 .
write down your name and address , give me the key , and i will check it out .
do you charge for checking it out ?
no .
how long is it going to take ?
about half an hour .
i'll wait .
may i have your order , please ?
yes , i'd like to have a share of steak .
ok . how do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ?
i like it well-done , please .
anything else ?
one whisky .
do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . and anyway , i believe if you live a low stress life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . it's all in the mind .
you have the point . i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
what's special about these things ?
cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-i think it's also tastier than normal rice . yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
thanks . i'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
i can't believe my eyes , bill . are you having a salad for lunch ? no hamburger ?
get used to it , mary . i'm off hamburgers for good health . most fast food is loaded with sodium .
i know . but why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ?
my doctor says i should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure .
do you have hypertension ? i would have thought you were too young .
actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age .
well , i'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet .
i want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too .
so do i . that's why i've been trying to lower my cholesterol level .
i've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently .
may i take your order ?
we haven't decided yet . could you give us a little longer ?
yes , take your time , please .
can we get something to drink ? we want two bottles of beer .
fine .
could you tell us your specials today ?
the special today is steak .
we'll take this steak dinner .
what would you like to go with your steak ?
peas and carrots .
i see . what would you like for dessert ?
icecream , please .
bob , look at this sentence . ' healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' it's interesting , isn't it ?
i'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ?
i believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .
probably , rose . that must be the job of nutritionists .
healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . so we are free to have whatever foods we love . it is unbelievable .
oh , believe it or not , i came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .
seriously ?
yes , i felt exactly the same way as you did just now . scientists must be crazy in saying so .
maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .
absolutely right . i myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . as long as i have enough energy , it's fine .
i think i need some iced water , too . is there an extra charge for that ?
yes . we charge 50 cents for iced water .
that's fine . could you give me some more napkins , too ?
sure . do you need anything else ?
yes . i would also like some sweet-and-sour sauce and pepper .
i'll put all that into the bag for you .
do i owe you for the sauce , pepper and napkins ?
no , there's no charge for those .
can i take your order ?
i'll take two value meals .
what kind of drink do you want with those meals ?
one coca cola and the other a sprite , please .
you can super-size your meals for only three dollars extra .
yes , i'd like that , then .
how about anything for dessert , like an apple pie or ice cream ?
no , thanks . that will be it .
may i help you ?
give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large coke .
you need to wait a few minutes for the fries . they are still in the flyer .
that's fine .
your total comes to $ 7 .
here's a twenty note .
thank you . your cash back is $ 13 . pull into a parking space . and we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
thanks .
a table for two , please .
all right . how about this one by the window ?
thank you . it's fine .
may i take your order now , sir ?
what do you recommend ? we'd like some of your local specialities .
our restaurant is famous for its seafood .
one cream of fish soup and two portions of prawns .
shrimp salad is our speciality , took
no , i think it's enough .
what would you like to drink ?
good evening , mr . frank . bourbon on the rocks ?
no . this time i'll try chinese wine .
what about mao tai , one of the most famous liquors in china ? it's good indeed . it never goes to the head .
do people here drink a lot of liquors ?
some do , some don't . many people in the north are fond of liquors . i think it has something to do with the climate .
yes , it has . some mexicans are crazy . they drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . have you ever heard of " tequila sauta " ?
yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in mexico . people drink it with salt and lemon .
right . it's very strong , just like alcohol . ( frank sips mao tai . )
yes , besides mao tai , we have wu liang ye , fen jim and so on .
they say that showing wine tastes quite good . what's it ?
it's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like japanese sake . showing is a city in china .
i see .
by the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as great wall white wine .
thank you for telling me so much , i'll try them next time .
could you show me the t-shirt on the model ?
here you are . we have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
what's the price ?
$ 12 .
can you make it any cheaper ?
it is cheap .
i'll take it if you give me a discount .
$ 10 . that's the best i can do .
i'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife .
yes , sir . what price range do you have in mind ?
i'm not sure . i don't know very much about the price of pearls .
i see . let me show you some samples of various qualities . this one is very nice . it's three hundred and fifty dollars .
is there a price reduction ?
we are having a sale now . the price has already gone down .
how much is that one ?
it's two hundred and eighty dollars .

good morning , i want to send this parcel to taiwan .
airmail or surface mail ?
how long would surface mail take , compared with airmail ?
oh , anything up to 3 or 4 months for surface mail . it depends on the sailing of the ships . airmail would only take 1 to 2 weeks .
how much would this parcel cost me by airmail ?
just let me weigh it for you . that's 2 lb . and 6 oz . that's be £ 10 .
may i help you ?
do you have the latest lipstick from christian dior ?
yes . what colors do you like ?
any special colors ?
how about this one ?
can i try it on and see how it looks ?
of course . this product moisturizes at the same time .
looks good . i'll take it .

we have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ...
well , please bring me the cold beef .
what do you want to eat today ?
i feel like having some dumplings . let's go out to eat .
no need ! i know how to make dumplings . let's do it from scratch . can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? i don't think i can finish everything by myself .
of course . what do you want me to do ?
just trim vegetables for cooking . i will cut up the meat .
i can do that . and i would like to make dumplings later .
yeah , you are my good helper , steven .
absolutely .
darling , i am back . what are you doing ?
i am washing clothes . are you hungry now ? wait for a moment , i'll cook dinner for you . ( steven bends his brows )
b , should we get a maid ?
i can do all the housework . we don't need a maid .
you have worked very hard in the office . if we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
we really don't need to .
you are a good wife , julia . but you must take care of yourself .
give me some time to think about it .
what do you think of this coffee table ?
it's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room .
how about this one ?
oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean .
alright , let's look at some others .
look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive .
darling , this dress is for you . i hope you like it .
oh , very beautiful . thank you , steven , i like it very much .
your birthday is coming , and i think this dress suits you . why not try it now ?
my birthday present ? i can't help telling you that i am a happy woman , darling . i will come back soon . ( go to her bedroom and wear the new dress , then show it to steven . )
it fits me exactly . how does it look like ?
it displays your slender figure , darling .
the most important thing is that you bought it for me . i am happy that you know my size and style .
because you are my dear wife .
excuse me , waiter , i would like to have some wine before the main course .
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i have no idea . maybe you can give me some advice .
i recommend you the white wine . it will wake up your appetite .
i am sorry , i have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ?
sure . i will clean the glasses for you .
thank you . where is the washing room ?
walk straight and turn left .
i want to keep a pet , but i don't know which one to buy ?
dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
what about cats ? they are more independent .
actually , i was thinking of something a little more exotic . i don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
yeah , are they easy to look after ?
yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
what's the chef's specialty ?
it's fried sole .
bring me one and besides , i would like to have a chicken cream soup .
sure . please wait for a moment .
would you like to order now ?
yes , can you recommend some steak ?
sure . i think pepper steak is quite good . many guests like it very much .
ok i will try it . do you have a small portion ? i am afraid i can't finish the large one .
would you like something to drink ?
yes , do you have a wine list ?
here you are .
bring us a bottle of remy martini and red wine .
are you through with your meal ?
yes , i am . could i have the bill , please ?
here is your bill . 150 yuan in all .
do you accept check ?
no , i'm sorry we don't . we accept credit cards and cash .
well , i'd like to pay by cash .
ok . ( a few minutes later ) sorry to keep you waiting . here is your change .
thanks .
may i take your order ?
i would like to have shelled shrimps with cashew nuts .
anything else ?
strawberry cake as dessert , please . by the way , could you serve my main course without garlic and put less ginger in it .
could you recommend something to drink ?
well , since you have order the roast chicken . i suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . it can help you digest the food .
we would also like some alcohol before the main dish .
i think whiskey will be a good choice .
waiter , please bring me some toast .
sure . what kind of toast do you like ?
pardon ?
we have white toast , whole wheat toast and rye toast .
i see , bring me the whole wheat toast .
anything to drink ?
bring me some toast , please .
would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
spread some jam , please .
anything to drink ?
welcome , sir , what can i do for you ?
i want to buy some records .
whose record do you want ?
are there the records of michael jackson ?
his records have been sold out . the new copies will be available next week .
oh . it's too late . maybe i should go to other video stores to have a look .
what would you like to order , sir ?
i'd like to try some chinese food .
we serve different styles of chinese food here . but i'm not sure which one do you prefer .
i have no idea . could you recommend some to me ?
well . cantonese food is rather light , beijing food is heavy , and sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
oh , i see . i'd like to have hot food .
if so , i suggest you have a taste for sichuan food . most sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes .
really ? so do you have some specialties ?
yes . roasted crispy chicken and spicy beef are our specialties .
all right . i'll have them .
excuse me , i ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .
well , sir , i think i have made a mistake . i will take it back to the kitchen right now .
i think you should be more careful next time .
yes , sir . i'm really so sorry about that .
excuse me , do you serve breakfast here ?
sure , you want a continental one or an american one ?
an american one , please . i am in a hurry .
ok , sir , yours will be ready in a few seconds .
may i take your order now ?
yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak .
do you want some salad dressing ?
yes , what kind do you have ?
we have italian , french , thousand island and blue cheese .
i think french will be fine .
do you take vitamin pills regularly ?
no , i don't , do you ?
yes . maybe you should do it too . you may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know .
but , i don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins .
how's that .
because it's better , easier and cheaper to get them from the food we eat .
what kind of breakfast do you want ?
is there any difference ?
yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . american one is the same as a continental one except the egg .
i think i would like the former one .
what are you going to take ?
roast pork chops with a bottle of red wine , please . is soup served here ?
of course . what kind of soup do you like ? clear or thick ?
clear soup . i think tomato soup is fine .

what kind of flowers do you want ?
i have no idea .
how about rose ? it's the most suitable one for lovers .
but rose is too common .
well , what about violet ? it means the eternal beauty .
it looks good . pack me a bouquet of violet , please .
may i order , please ?
of course .
i would like sirloin steak and tomato salad .
do you take dressing on your salad ?
how do you like the food ?
it tastes really great . did you cook it ?
yes . i made it this afternoon . would you like some more ?
ok , just a little though . i'm really full .
oh . would you like some soup instead ?
what kind is it ?
tomato and rice . have you had that before ?
no . this is my first time . how does it taste ?
it's good , try it . what do you think ?
wow . it is good . did you make that also ?
yes .
you're a really good cook .
thanks , next time i'll make chicken soup for us .
that sounds good . did you study cooking in school ?
tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ?
why did you ask that ? do you want to buy the used goods ?
i'm considering buying a second-hand computer for i'm short of money now .
you know the car i'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . and it only cost me 300 dollars . it was so cheap .
but do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ?
it depends . so you must be careful buying second-hand goods .
is there anything i can do for you ?
excuse me , can i change my order ? i am afraid i don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
i am sorry , sir . your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
that's all right .

wait a moment . here you are .
by the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .

annie , do you like shopping online ?
yes , i like it , because it's convenient .
last week , i tried to buy a new cellphone online , but i didn't know how to pay for it .
first , you should open an account at the online bank . after that , you can buy anything you want online .

three for ten cents .
give me a dozen lemons .
anything else ?
no , thanks . how much in total ?
twenty eight dollars .
are you being served , sir ?
i'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room .
artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . how about these ones ?
these are beautiful ! is this the marvelous landscape in guiling ?
yes , sir .
how fine the needlework is ! what's the price ?
ninety dollars .
it's too expensive .
but considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more .
you're right . would you please show me some embroidery ? i also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry .
waiter , i would like to order now .
sure . what do you want to have today ?
cream soup and steak , please .
how do you like your steak ?
excuse me , what does that mean ?
well , there are several kinds of steaks . for example , you can have your steaks medium-rare , medium-well or well-done .
you look so excited . what happened ?
you are not going to believe this . do you remember the dress we saw at mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? i got it today at half price .
so they have started the year end sale earlier this year .
how can you stay so calm ? aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ?
i guess i'll wait a few more days . there maybe even bigger discount then .
but there won't be anything good left .
wow , what a cool car ! the styling of this car really appeals to me .
yes , this is a very popular car .
i want to buy it . how much does this car cost ?
the car is beautiful , isn't it ? come on inside and we'll discuss the price .
you can tell me here . i just want to know the price .
50000 yuan ' what a deal ! that will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee .
i appreciate your help , but i think i'll look around a bit .
then what price would be fair to you ?
i think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car .
i can see that you are a smart buyer . forty thousand is my best price .
can't you make it cheaper ? i still can't afford the car .
38000yuan is my final offer .
welcome , sir . what can i do for you ?
may i have a look at that china tea set ? it is extremely beautiful .
you've made a good choice . this china tea set is unusual . it was made in jingdezhen .

one thousand dollars .
it's a lot of money . but the picture is excellent , i'll take it .
you ran the stop sign . may i see your driver's licence , please ?
oh , i'm sorry . i didn't see the stop sign at the corner . i didn't mean it .
that doesn't justify your violation . may i see your licence , please ?
oh , sorry , i don't have it on me . honestly , i forgot it at the house . but i have the insurance policy with me . here it is .
well , sir , your insurance looks good , but i still have to write you a ticket .
i understand , officer . i guess it's just not my day today . i will accept the fine .
do you see that small white car over there ? it ’ s tom ’ s new car .
oh , my god . it ’ s beautiful . but it looks expensive .
it is very expensive . tom ’ s father paid for it .
i want to have a car like that . but i am not rich . and i don ’ t have a rich daddy .
excuse me , i'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot .
oh , really ? isn't this spot c408 ?
no , it's d408 , my parking space . i have already paid for it .
i'm sorry , i must have been confused . i had thought it's c section , but actually it's d section . i'll move my car right away .
hi , bob . i heard that you had passed your driving test . is it true ?
yes . a few days ago i have no right to get a driving licence . but now i get it .
is the driving test difficult ?
yes , it can be quite tough . many people fail to pass the test at the first time .
what does the driving test require ?
you should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . after you pass both tests , you'll get your licence .
oh , i see . i need more practice before i take the driving test .
don't worry about your driving test . i think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon .
have you decided on something ?
yes , please bring us two steaks .
sure . anything else ?
what vegetables come with the steaks ?
can i help you , sir ?
yes . fill it up , please .
ok . what kind of gas do you want ?
i don't really know . i have just bought this new car . and it's the first time i've gotten gas for it .
we have regular , super , and premium gasoline . this is a new car , so i'd recommend premium .
premium , please . thanks . please fill it up .
all right , sir . you will park at refueling 4 .
ok , thanks .
your car's ready .
good . how much does it come to ?
ten gallons of premium . that's $ 18.56 , please .
ok . here you are .
everything is ok now , doctor .
that was quick work . let me have a look at it . yeah , everything looks fine now . thank you very much .
you are welcome , doctor .
how much do i owe you ?
the total is 87 dollars . here is the bill .
really ? you worked here for just half an hour . i consider the price very high .
have you made up your mind ?
not yet , can you recommend me some chickens ?
we have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops .
please bring me the chicken chops .
sir , here is your curried beef .
well . i am afraid you have made a mistake . it's not the dish i ordered .
let me see , i am sorry . it's for table 11 .
it doesn't matter .
waiter , we have been waiting for 20 minutes . would you mind hurrying ?
i am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish .
that's fine . would you please bring me some wine ?
sure , is dry white wine ok ?
how do you like you dishes today ?
not so delicious as before , but it's fine . the soup is tasty but the meat is a little tough .
do you like the food here ?
yes . the baked fish was out of this world .
i am glad you like it .
can we have the bill now ?
steven , what are you thinking about ?
oh , you know , tomorrow is vicky's birthday . i am thinking what gift to give her .
that's easy . a girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments . how about a hair pin ?
it's a bad idea . vicky has short hair .
well , what about a brooch ?
only old women like that .
maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday .
ok . that's what i can do .
you sure are buying a lot of things online .
yes , i ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . they will be delivered in two weeks .
what are the advantages of buying online ?
sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun .
good afternoon , how may i help you ?
hi , i'd like to order some flowers .
who are they for ?
they're for my wife . her name is samantha .
what kind of flowers would you like ?
i don't know . i don't know too much about flowers . can you recommend something ?
ok . what's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
i'm not sure . i know i should know that , but i can't remember right now .
well , they're for your wife , so i think you should give her roses .
roses will be fine .
what color ?
i think red would be nice .
do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
can you deliver them , please ?
what's the address ?
241 main street .
let's have lunch together today .
it's a good idea .
i want a hamburger and ice cream . what about you ?
i don't like hamburgers . they have no taste .
what about cheese cake or apple pie ?
maybe i want an apple pie .
waiter , the dish is cold to eat . could you please heat it up for me ?
sure . wait a moment .
by the way , i would like some chilli oil .
ok .
is there a sofa in the living room ?
i am afraid there isn ’ t .
that ’ s too bad . is there a desk in the living room then ?

they are behind the door .
that dog has white long hair . it ’ s lovely .
she is my dog . i like her very much .

her name is fluffy . she is a sweet dog .
my dog has spots . he is very strong .

well , would you please clean the livingroom ? you know i'm too busy .
steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the new year's party . would you like to join us ?
i'd love to ! but i have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the new year .
that's ok . a month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . it would be great to have you with us on the show .
sounds great ! shall i learn the actions that jet li did in the movies ?
no . you know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . what we will perform is a set of chinese shadow boxing .

here is your bill . it's $ 60 .
what's this amount for ?
it's for the drinks .
i see . can i pay by credit card ?
you seem to be upset . what ’ s eating you ?
it ’ s because of my son . dick keeps getting on my nerves
dick ? how come ? he used to be as meek as a lamb .
yes , he used to be . but now he ’ s drifting off track .
professor li , do you know where to buy art supplies ?
for what ? are you taking up painting ?
no . i can't paint . i'm asking for my niece . she is really into it .
oh , good . how old is your niece ?
she is eight . actually , i'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift .

what's on channel 12 at 8: 00 ?
if i remember correctly , there's a quiz show .
do you want to watch it ?
let's see what else is on first .
hey , steven . what are you going to do this saturday ?
if the weather is good , i'll go to climb mountains .
are you going with your friends ?
no , i'm going alone .
oh , aren't you afraid ?
of course not . for me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby .
i think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous .
yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting .
waiter , please make out the bill .
ok , sir . how do you like your meal ?
quite delicious , especially the pepper steak .
i'm glad you like it . it's $ 60 in all .
is our destination the amusement park ?
yes , i think even though we are adults , it's still a good place for us to relax .
what are you going to enjoy ?
i want some exciting . which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ?
i like neither .
come on . here is for enjoying and exciting .
ok , let me think . the roller coaster looks more fun .
i like ferris wheel more .
it doesn't matter . we can go to the ferris wheel later .
ok , let's go .
hello , i want to order an easy-own package . what would you recommend ?
which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ?
about the same . but i'm looking for a job , so i have to answer the phone often .
then i recommend this package to you . you can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month .
that's good . how can i order it ?
sending a message ' ktctwy ' to 10086 will do .
thank you . i'll have a try .
you're welcome .
can i pay my bill here ?
yes , sir .
how much is the charge ?
let me see ... it's $ 50 .
do you receive checks ?
sorry , sir . we receive credit card and cash only .
hey , jim , you're 15 minutes late . what's up ?
i got stuck in a traffic jam .
hurry up , the show is about to start .
it looks like you're very interested in the circus .
yes , i love to see the animal show .
i have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
i'm sure you'll love it .
okay , i will go and get some popcorn first .
dad , how can we get to the zoo ?
we can take a bus there .
does this bus go there ?
i think so .
let's step in , dad .
no , it's too crowded .
dad . here comes another bus .
fine . let's get on . oh , no , judy ! get off the bus quickly !
why ? dad ?
we got on the wrong bus .
there's a question i'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask .
you know that i have no secrets toward you .
when you go dinner with john , who foots the bill ?
why asking that ? it's often the sort of dutch treat .
waiter , can i have the bill please ?
wait a moment . it's $ 30 .
we'd prefer separate checks .
ok , one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12 .
hello , could i make a reservation ?
sure . at what time ?
6 o'dock in the evening .
let me see ... sorry , sir . we are fully booked tonight . would you mind making a reservation some other time ?
do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ?
yes , sir .
could i have a refund on this ?
i'm afraid you can ’ t .
then can i exchange it for something else with the same price ?
just a moment . let me find out . our manager wil be here in a minute . so will you speak to him ?
switchboard . which extension would you like ?
extension 1616 , please .
i'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . just hold on , please .
then , will you try extension 235 ?
you are an early bird , tom . what do you do in the morning then ?
exercise . the morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . we should not pass them up easily . seize the time and do something useful .
so , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . where do you exercise ?
usually , i run to the black bamboo park as a warm-up . admission is free . then i start my activities .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
no , i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park .
why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them .
can i help you ?
yes , i need to buy a computer for this semester . i was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .
well , you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
i don't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer .
well , first let's consider your computer . here , for example , is a system i highly recommend-the power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
is that a lot ? sixty-four ?
yes , it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
history .
well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it , as it only goes until next tuesday . if you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a power macintosh g3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price .
thirty percent ?
yes .
wow . that's really good . and you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?
yes . it's an excellent system .
hmm . hey , wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ?
yes , it's a macintosh . it's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
i don't want macintosh . i want pc .
i'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
what ? are you serious ?
yes .
but nobody uses macintosh !
that's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you're from ?
yes , i'm from taiwan .
well , i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america , especially in universities and publishing companies , apple is very commonly used .
but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i'm sorry .
no , don't be sorry . it's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me , most of the students here in the university-asian students included-most of them use apple .
well , thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
okay . this trail looks the best . it's a little steep . but i'm sure it will be alright .
well . you're the tour guide , i'll follow you .
... what a stink . this place stinks like rotten eggs .
that's sulphur you can smell . the whole of taiwan is a volcanic region . that's why taiwan has so many hot springs . it's volcanic activity.the sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there .
what would you like for your main dish ?
steak , please .
how would you like it ?
medium rare , please .
anything else , sir ?
may i have a glass of red wine , please ?
excuse me . can you take me to the airport ?
which airport , ma'am ?
kennedy airport .
all right , ma'am . need any help with your luggage ?
how about going swimming ?
ok . where should we go ?
why don't we go down to the pool ? it's not too far from here .
fine . i'll be ready in a minute .
hello , this is sheila from huawei corp . is that li lei ?
yes , speaking .
i am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . are you free tomorrow ?

yes . where do you want to go ?
the workers'stadium .
this is the right bus .
will you let me know where to get off ?
certainly.four more stop after this . i'll call out the stops .
anything else , sir ?
that's all for now . how much do i owe you ?
that'll be fifty-five dollars and twenty cents .
can't you make it a little cheaper ?
oh , no , sir . we already gave you a discount on each item .
ok . i understand . thank you .
may i see that ivory horse ?
of course .
it's genuine , i bet .
it's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . the price is marked 200 yuan .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the cross bakery building ?
the cross bakery building ? oh sure . you're actually walking in the opposite direction .
oh , you're kidding ! i thought i was heading east .
no , east is the other direction . to get to the bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to broadway . when you get to the intersection of broadway and elm , you hang a left . go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left .
okay , let me see if i've got that . i need to go down elm until i hit broadway , then i make a left and the building is on my left hand side . is that right ?
yeah , you've got it . do you want me to show you the way ?
hello . can i speak to alice , please ?
hold on , please .
thank you .
sorry , but she's out .
would you tell her tom gray called ?
i'd be glad to .

seventy cents a piece .
how about this one ?
sixty cents a piece .
well , i'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ?
sure ! they are very fresh , first of all . we sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . eighty cents only , a piece .
i follow you and i'll take three just for my trial .
thank you very much and anything else ?
may i help you ?
could i have a look at those pens ?
certainly . these are thirty yuan each and these are twenty-five .
have you got anything a bit cheaper ?
how about these ? they are nine yuan each .
no , they're not quite what i want . sorry to trouble you .
can i have my money back on this skirt ?
anything wrong with it ?
yes , this is defective . see ? i didn't notice this hole when i bought it .
oh , i'm very sorry about that . you can change it for another one if you prefer .
if you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course .
this one is the same size and color . but the design is different .
what can i do for you ?
do you have any blue shirts ?
yes . what's your size ?
i'm not familiar with american size .
all right . let me see . i think you'd wear a size 8 . this shirt is size 8 .
it's pretty . may i try it on ?
sure . the fitting room is over there .
thank you .
i often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe .
annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . i think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully .
although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . if the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield .
the skateboard does not pollute the air , either . it can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk .
have you got any outdoor interests ?
yes . my only recreation is skateboarding .
oh , i know it . it is included in extreme sports . i think it's too dangerous for me .
maybe . but it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . i'm getting to like the game more and more .
do you want to buy something here ?
these shoes are great ! what is the price of this ?
this one is two hundred yuan .
that's too much !
what do you want to do tonight ?
i don't know . what do you want to do ?
i have no idea . do you think we're in a rut ?
what do you mean ?
well , we do the same things every weekend . we go to the same restaurants . we see the same friends . you know what i mean ?
yeah , i guess you're right . it's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . let's break out and do something completely different tonight .
okay , i'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . hmm , we could go to a concert . there is a good one tonight . i bet it's not sold out . but , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue .
an hour ? that's a bit of a bummer . let me take a peek and see what else there is . how about going dancing ? we haven't done that in a while . there's a club in silver lake that's supposed to be hopping on friday nights . eddie from work told me that they have a really good dj and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad .
i'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . you know what ? i just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . how about you ?
yeah , i was hoping you'd say that . it's nice to have the option to go out but i'd rather stay in . maybe we can go out tomorrow night .
what kind of permanent would you like to have ?
what kinds do you have ?
oh , we have quite a regular , cold perm , straight perm , pin curl and foam .
last time i tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . set the wave a little looser than usual , please .
i think yoga might be suitable for me .
why ?
because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too .
i don't know . i just need to try it once . i'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .
what are you waiting for ? get on that bus quickly .
but where do i get a ticket ?
on the bus . the driver collects the fares . you'll have to take your luggage on board .
oh , i wish i didn ’ t have so much to carry .
do you carry black ink ?
the ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir .
i've looked for , but i didn't see any black ink .
then i'm afraid there's none in stock .
well , i'll settle for blue-black . i'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes .
they come in packages of ten or twenty .
give me a package of twenty , then . and where do i find shoelaces ?
on counter three .
thank you . i never can find my way around this store .
i know . it took me three weeks , and i work here .
excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ?
this one . it is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . you may try it on .
that is nice . but i don't quite like the collar .
the collar ? it is just the collar that is popular with young people in shanghai .
i don't care what others wear . how much is it ?
250 yuan .
really ? too expensive . i don't think i can afford it .
but it is really worthwhile .
ok , anyway , let me have it .
here you are .
excuse me , which way is to the post office ?
the post office ? sorry , i'm not sure .
next , please . where to , sir ?
a one-way ticket to chicago , please .
how many did you say , sir ?
one adult , please .
i'm interested in chinese antiques .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques . besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .
i'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
how about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? it was painted by a famous chinese painter in king dynasty .
oh , they look just like live cranes .
and what is more , in traditional chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
what did you say your stop was ?
fifth avenue .
oh , then you should have gotten off at the last stop .
i should have ?
mary , come here . i've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week .
really ? how much is it ? oh , it's 42 yuan ! how expensive !
you know , it is the best seller for this year . it has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year .
how come ? i have never seen such a popular book before .
wait a minute . i found there were two printings . the paperback books must be much cheaper .
you are right . let's buy the cheaper one .
excuse me . is this seat taken ?
no , it isn't .
am i on right bus to chicago ?
oh , no . this is going in the opposite direction .
oh , my god !
i suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station .
excuse me , where is the beijing railway station ?
you can take the subway to get there .
how long will it take to get there ?
it takes only ten minutes .
may i take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
you can take no . i bus or a taxi .
excuse me , sir . where is the no . 1 bus stop ?
please turn right at the traffic lights .
excuse me , can you tell me where main street is ?
turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
is it far ?
no . it's only a five-minute walk . you can't miss it .
thanks a lot .
you're welcome .
what's the fare , please ?
twenty dollars and sixty cents .
what ? you're overcharging me !
no way . look . that's what the meter says .
what can i show you ?
do you have this shirt in a small ?
let me check . yes , we have .
may i try it on ?
do you think i should join the basketball team , mary ?
why not ? if i were you , i certainly would .
but i'm afraid it'll take up too much of my time .
as the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . all work and no play makes jack a dull boy , you know ?
hello , oriental hotel .
i'd like to speak to michael baker , please .
i'm sorry , mr . baker is not in . may i take a message ?
yes.tell him mr.cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
excuse me , could you lend me some of your records ?
until when ?
until monday or tuesday next week .
no problem .
i was wondering if you'd let me stay here for a few days .
it really depends on when and how long .
would you mind doing something for me ?
i would if i could .
will you please explain the meaning of this word ?
yes , with pleasure .
hello , elizabeth . how are you ?
fine , thanks .
are you sure you're all right ? you look a bit worried today . is anything wrong ?
well , yes , there is something wrong actually . perhaps you can give me some advice .
of course , if i can .
well , last night when i returned from the theatre , i found that i'd lost my wallet .
oh dear ! that's terrible ! what was in your wallet ?
well , some money . of course , my visa , all my identity cards and some photos .
well , if were you , i'd go to the police station straight away and report it .
yes , i've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . but we're leaving soon and i need my visa and identity cards badly .
oh dear ! what a pity ! are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ?
yes , quite sure .
i think you should put an advertisement in the china daily , saying when and where you lost it .
but that takes too long .
excuse me . will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? i just want to make a phone call .
certainly , but will it take long ?
no , i'll be right back .
ok . i'll look after it then .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i'm looking for a black , leather bag .
how's this ?
i'm just looking .
can i help you ?
how much is this pen ?
ten yuan .
and how much is this pencil ?
one yuan .
here's fifteen yuan .
and here's your change . please check if it is correct .
ok , that's right .
welcome to come again .
ok .
last night i looked for my indian classmate barbara . i found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing .
needless to say , it must be indian yoga .
mary , you say something about it .
tracing back , yoga has a very long history . it was originated before india had approved yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . in other words , yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled .
can i help you ?
yes , i'd like to have a look at the 2 - piece suit .
what size do you wear ?
middle size
then please look at this suit .
does this suit come in other color ?
yes , we have some in blue , green , black and brown .
how much is the brown one ?
us $ 138 .
then i'll take it .
welcome to our shop . it seems you are interested in this dress .
yes . but i am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer .
that's no problem . it is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . i can assure you it is of superior quality . what is more , it is very popular with young women .
how much is it ?
88 yuan .
ok , that is reasonable . i will take it .
you're made a good choice . this china tea set is unusual .
where was it from ?
it was made in jingdezhen .
jingdezhen ? isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
you are right .
this is the very thing i've been dreaming of .
it is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell china .
it must be most precious .
show me a smaller pair of trousers , sir . i am not that fat , you see .
you've come to the right place . we've got various styles and sizes recently . how much do you measure around your waist ?
i have no idea . measure me , please .
ok ! 2 chi round . try this one . maybe it's of your size .
( after trying ) i'm afraid it's still too fight around the stomach .
let me check the stock . how about this one ?
( after trying ) mm , a perfect fit . how much ?
150 yuan .
a little expensive . but i'll buy it anyway . it's hard for me to get a perfect one . here is 200 yuan .
here's your change , 50 yuan . welcome back again .
can you help me find my books ?
certainly , do you have your school schedule ? the books are arranged by course number and instructor .
say , what's you favorite sport ?
mmmm ... , it's hard to say . i like golf a lot-but i guess like skating better .
do you know how to skate , like a skater ?
no , i'm strictly a spectator . i just like watching skating . it's so beautiful .
here . keep the change .
oh , thank you very much .
you're welcome . by the way , is there a pay phone near here ?
yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . do you have any small change ?
what a lovely tapestry ! don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ?
i think we can have a try .
artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical chinese style .
i see . is this the marvelous landscape in guiling ?
i think it is .
which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ?
where do these flower vases come from ?
they are made a town nearby . the flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks .
are they breakable ?
no . they are not only ornamental , but also useful .
can i help you , sir ?
you have so many antiques and chinese paintings here . may i have a look first ?
of course .
are they genuine ?
may i help you ?
yes . fill it up , please .
premium or regular ?
regular , please .
anything else , sir ? should i check the water and the oil ?
yes , please .
may i help you find something , or are you just looking ?
i'm just looking .
then take your time , please .
thank you .
ouch ! i'm hurt .
are you all right ?
yes . i'm ok . i just had a tumble . no big deal .
good . you scared me .
sorry . can you please help me up ! i have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on .
sure . is this your first time skiing ?
welcome to jinyuan shoe town . what can i do for you ?
i'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans .
white ? what make do you want ? arid what size ?
adidas . size 38 .
adidas ? they wear well . try this pair , size 38 , please .
yes . ( after trying ) a bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . have you got a larger pair . size 39 ?
okay . what about this one ?
( after trying ) mm , this pair fits me well . i'll take it . how much is it ?
you are so lucky . they are on sale today . it costs only 250 yuan . pay at the counter over there .
ok . thank you .
i saw on tv that there is an entertainment item , bungee in beijing longtanhu park . except that the height is not exiting enough .
you say how high can be exciting ?
the highest bungee spot in the world is located in mount kikicama , south africa , which is 216 meters high . a cable car in a scenic spot in switzerland is 160 meters high .
i know that frenchmen installed the bungee cord between two tall buildings .
it is said that bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of new guinea . people stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . when they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently .
luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more .
do you mind if i open the window ?
if you don't mind , i'd rather you didn't . i have a cold and feel chilly .
oh , that's too bad . should i call a doctor ?
i'd appreciate it if you would .
are you being served , sir ?
no , not yet . i just want a haircut .
will you sit here , please ? how would you like it cut ?
i want it short .
but it's short already , sir .
i mean very short , shorter than it is now .
shall i just trim it ?
no , you can cut quite a bit off . i like it to be very short all over . do you see what i mean ?
oh , i see . you like the chinese style , don't you ?
yes , in the chinese style .
would you like to have a shampoo , sir ?
no , thank you .
how about oil or spray ?
no , nothing of the kind .
there ! how is that ?
that's very good !
what's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ?
i'll have to check . do you need anything else ?
yes . five one-dollar stamps , please .
that'll be 14 dollars in all .
excuse me . you can't leave your car here .
oh , but i just want to pick up a package . it won't take long .
i'm afraid you'll have to find a parking meter .
can i park here just for a second ?
it's your turn , sir . i'm sorry that you had to wait . saturday is a busy day for us .
i suppose so . a haircut , please .
how do you want your hair cut ? any particular way ?
i'd just like a trim , and don't cut it too short .
yes , sir . how about the sideburns ?
i think they only need a little trimming .
can i use the clippers ?
no , don't use them , please .
oh , all right , sir .
would you trim off a bit more there , above the ear ?
don't you think it needs a little taken off on top , too ?
i guess that would be better .
( raising a lock ) about like this ?
no , not that much . now , yes , that's fine .
shave also , s ir ?
yes .
three twenty-five cent stamps , please .
here you are . seventy-five cents , please .
and please send this letter by registered mail .
is there anything valuable in it ?
there's a check for two hundred dollars and a photograph .
shall i make out a receipt ?
no , don't bother .
that will be ninety-five cents in all .
how can i help you ?
yes , i would like to look at some of your products . i think what i am using now does not fit me well .
we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
what do you have in foundation ?
our foundation is of very super quality . we only use the finest ingredients . it will moisturize your skin and it can protect your skin from uva and uvb .
what colors do you have in foundation ?
let me show you . we have six colors
the color i use now is natural beige . how much do you sell it for ?
250 yuan .
that's expensive .
what you're paying for , madam , is the ingredients . it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a weightless feel .
i understand . i need a lipstick , too . do you have lipsticks in red ?
of course . but i suggest you buy a lipgloss . the shining effect is in .
all right . how much is it ?
45 yuan . if you buy the two , you can get a small bottle of nail polish for free .
well , i'll take them .
hello ! are you shopping here today ? haven't i seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ?
i'm just comparing prices .
you should ! this thrift shop is really cheap , though , you have to pay cash here .
but they don't let you have goods on approval .
how did you get it ?
i found it a garage sale once .
what a find ! so , how much does it cost ?
well , because i like you ... ninety bucks .
i'd like to send this to chicago .
air mail or surface mail ?
air mail , please .
please put it on the scale there . seventy five cents .
make it special delivery , please .
oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . thank you .
would you tell me how i should send this parcel to shanghai , china ? it contains only books .
you might send it as'printed matter ' .
i wonder if i could have it insured here ?
of course . how much would you want to insure these books for ?
let me see ... i think i can have them insured for five hundred dollars .
five hundred dollars , so you pay ten dollars for the insurance , that's two percent of the total value of the article .
if you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . but you must look for them . there are also a few am-phibians in lower places .
well , let's move , i can see a rest area ahead.we can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ...
huh ! i am really out-of-shape , why aren't you out-of-breath ?
because i come hiking every week . that's why i'm in good-shape . i think that i should bring you a walkingstick next time .
how can you say that ? but , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way .
so , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . no problem , jump on .
i have found it quite different here from china since i came to the united states .
what's the difference ?
some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . it was so big . i think i could get lost if i went there alone .
you must have bought many things in the mall ?
not really many . i was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so i decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain .
it's wise to do it . the americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . and many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful .
i have heard about it while in china . it is called a " yard sale " . i didn't have any idea of that until today when i came here to the big " yard sale " .
you must have got many useful things for your new apartment .
does this tv work well ?
yes , it is almost new here .
is it a color tv or a black and white tv ?
it is a color tv . you know , the rich people like the digital one now . so they have no room for them .
hi , is that mr . wu ?
yes . what can i do for you ?
i am calling to query about some of your information .
we've got a bad line . can you repeat that please ?
i said i want to ask about some of your information .
sorry , the connection is terrible . i'll call you back because i can't hear anything .
( bob groans . ) what's the matter.bob ?
i think it's my ankle .
what happened ?
one of my snowshoes got caught on a rock .
can you stand ?
i don't think so.it ' s kind of sore .
we'll have to get you to a hospital for an x-ray .
is that really necessary ?
it may be worse than it seems . how's it feel ?
about the same .
someone will be out to take a look any minute now .
should we be here , alice ? i don't think it's that serious .
of course ! it's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . will we have to wait much longer ?
i hope not.it isn't that busy .
in 1986 , a new zealander hackett popularized bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . this sport is very challenging . it is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . the timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . no wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
you see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . the wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . they do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
a young french fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " when i fastened the cord and walked to the platform , i was extremely nervous . when i looked down , i was nervous even more . if the cord had broken , i would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . however , i knew my worries were unwanted . i was afraid if i retreated others might say something about me . i had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . i only felt wind wiring at my ears . my body rapidly descended . i thought that after only seven or eight seconds i was rebounded to upper air by the cord . in fact it was 30 seconds . maybe because of my nervousness , i only felt seven or eight seconds . when rebounding to the high altitude , i felt a sudden sense of relief . i did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . "
wow ! what a beautiful scenic spot . it's so open . and just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
you can have a bird view of chilin city from the top of the mountain .
wonderful ! i'll often come here for mountain climbing .
you should . many guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the coming .
no wonder people say , even the immortals would rather be guiliners .
... quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird ... i've never seen one of those before . it's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky .
i didn't know you liked bird watching .
i don't really . i just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
where are you going to play this weekend ?
i have not given it much thought . do you have any good suggestions ?
i want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . the city is too noisy . do you know tangle temple ?
i have been there . it is in the middle of the mountains . it is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian .
do you want to climb the mountain with us ?
does it have enough lodging ?
no problem . the temple is quite large .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
i'm getting a little excited now . what clothes should i wear ?
take some thick clothes with you . it is rather cold there at night . if you wear the t-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' .
anything else i should bring ?
if you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you .
would you please weigh this letter to see what the postage is ?
do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ?
by ordinary air mail , please .
anything of value in it ?
a postal order for four hundred dollars .
in that case , you'd better have it registered .
will i be informed when my friend gets the letter ?
yes , when your friend gets it , he'll sign a receipt , which will be sent to you by mail . then you can be sure it's been received .
i need some mascara . do you have good thickening mascara ?
of course . here is our thickening mascara . we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
alright . and i want to consider your eye shadow too . do you have a color chart can look at ?
we have a very wide selection of colors . and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . so it is very gentle on your eyelids . would you like to sample some ?
oh , sure i will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
i can help you with that .
how can i help you ?
yes , i would like to look at some of your products .
did you have anything specific in mind ?
well , to be honest , i mostly use sarah winter products now . but i'm not happy with them . so i would like to change companies .
well , you made a good choice . coming to us , i mean . we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
what do you have in foundation ?
our foundation is very high quality , only the finest ingredients . it will moisturize your skin and it has a sun block rating of 8 .
what colours do you have in foundation ?
let me show you . we have this rose colour . we also have different shoes of beige .
the color i use now is rose . how much does this rose foundation cost ? the 100ml bottle .
ln this size , we sell it for 53.95 .
wow ! that's expensive .
what you're paying for , ma'am , are the ingredients . it is a very high quality product .
i understand .
are you interested in mountaineering ?
yes , in some sense . i should say i like mountain climbing , you know , because i'm not so professional . how about you
i'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . i went climbing in the rocky mountains with my friends last summer vacation . we spent two days in the mountains .
how did you spend the night there ?
we pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . wow ! it was too beautiful .
i had a similar experience , but that was on the top of tasha mountain in my country .
tasha mountain ? it's very famous in china , isn't ?
yes . it is one of the five mountains .
i want to climb tasha mountain this summer vacation . would you be my guide ?
i'd love to .
may i help you ? miss !
yes . i'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow .
what color set do you prefer ?
well , brown .
we have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . look at the colors . aren't they beautiful ?
but they're purple . i prefer a brown set .
if you insist , i can show you the brown sets . i'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though .
well , i'm not so sure . most of my make-up is brown .
why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? we also have lipstick to go with it .
can i try it ?
sure . are you wearing any make-up ?
no .
have a seat , please . now , here is the mirror . how do you like it ?

yes . with the 60 - second digital memory , i can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow !
you'll love this ! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .

good afternoon ! where to ?
tian'anmen square .
you are going to tian'anmen square . no problem .

i have your catalog here . do you want me to tell you the item numbers , or the names ?

good morning .
may i take your order ?
yes . i'd like your breakfast special , please .
how would you like your egg ?
soft-boiled , please .

well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports .

using mp3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your cd player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk .

you can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 d mode and mega bass features . we rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones .

it's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip .

how do you want your eggs ?
fried , please .
anything more , sir ?
no , that's enough . t hank you .
i find that you spend little on handset charge every month . have you any trick ?
it's simple . you can use call transfer .
is it so simple ?
sure . you know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so i receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so i need pay little for receiving calls .
it's true .
call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and i will not miss any call .
that's all ?
in hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . if you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .
do you have a reservation , sir ?
no , i am afraid we don't .
i'm sorry . the restaurant is full now . you have to wait for about half an hour . would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ?

would you like anything else , sir ?

oh , i'm so sorry . i thought you had one . here you are .
don't you have any chinese food ?

not very much . it sounds too emotional to me .
that's why it is so popular . it was recorded by barbara tutin . i've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation .
i'm afraid my association with broadway musicals is rather limited .

what kind of games do you like ?
big games of course .
i see , but games are played in different ways . i'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ?
type ? i don't know , what do you have ?
basically , there are 7 types of games
well , i am a beginner . i ...
don't worry . most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration .
i like first person shooting and action more than other types of games .
if so , counter strike and might & magic are good alternatives . counter strike is one of the hottest shooting games and might & magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes .
oh , thanks a lot . then , i will take the two .
do you want the latest editions ? if your computer runs fast , i think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive .

and can i have some ketchup , please ?
tu mao , i'm hungry , let's get something to eat .
me too . is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat ?
there's a kentucky's not far ahead and there's a mcdonald's in down street .
kentucky's ? is that a chain restaurant ?
don't you know about kentucky's ?
i've heard about it , but never had one .

that's a good idea . let's bring our trunks and towels .
would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ?
i'd prefer the pool .
ok . let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room .
what style do you use ?
how do you usually part your hair ?
to the right .
( the hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) almost done . i just have to even things up a bit . ( she shows the customer the results . ) will that do ?

can anyone tell me where i can buy the ingredients to make chinese food ?
there is a supermarket in kensington high street . i'll come and give you a hand .
that is good of you .

i'm after things to stuff dumplings with , like chinese cabbage
the fruit and vegetables are over there .
pork . where's the meat counter ?
over there .
hello , sir . what can we do for you today ?
i'd like a trim .
would you like your hair washed as well ?
no , thanks .
okay , have a seat over here . how do you want it cut ?
cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . leave just a little over the ears .
i'm planning to buy a bicycle . as you are quite a cycling enthusiast , i wish you might give me some advice .
with pleasure , chap . but before i start , i need to know what you want a bike for ?
my purposes are two-fold . on the one hand , i've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . on the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and i intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends .
cycling during weekends ? do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ?
does that make any difference ?
can't be greater . if you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . but if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike .
are they designed differently ?
a road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . it's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . in contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . you sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over .
this place is great . i'm surprised there are so many things here .
yes , but it takes a while to find things . it's not organized as carefully as a regular store .
what's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?
usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . the prices are very low . but you may find faulty products here too .
faulty products ?
yes . sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . so it's a good deal to buy it .
oh , that's easy for me . i think it's really a good deal .
yes . you can save a lot of money in this way .
that's great for me . look , children's clothes ! i'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter .
why not buy the sweater ? it only costs 30 yuan .
yes , i'll take it . are there any jeans ? xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . i also need four pairs of slippers .
how many do you want to buy ?
i ought to make the most of it while i'm here , don't you think ?
you're right .
you're looking very well .
thank you . i try to keep in shape .
do you often exercise ?
yes , as long as i can find the time . i like swimming best .
what style of swimming do you like best ?
i like the back best . i am good at freestyle stroke , but i usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired .
i think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn .
i agree . i'm not good at it , either . can you swim ? how about going for a swim this saturday ?
welcome to flash foot , sir . how can i help you ?
i'd like extra prints made of these photos .
do you have your negatives ?
yes . here they are . i've marked how many prints i want on each shot .
what size do you want the prints ?
four by six , except this one . i want a ten by thirteen print of this one .
welcome to flash foot . what can i do for you , ma'am ?
i'd like to have this roll of film developed .
what size prints would you like ?
four by six will do .
what is my ideal weight ?
it depends on your height and body type .
how can i avoid injuring myself during exercise ?
by warming up before and cooling down after your workout .
sir , tell us about your experience with super bulk-up .
well , it's completely changed my life .
tell us how .
well , before , i was the skinniest guy on the beach .
and now ?
just look ! in six short weeks i've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle .
good afternoon , ma'am . can i help you find anything ?
no , thanks . i'm just looking .
we have a special on these skirts this week . would you like to try one on ?
no , thank you . i don't need any skirts .
how about a blouse ? this one here is the latest fashion .
no , thank you .
why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? i'm sure they'd look fabulous on you .
no doubt . look , i'm just browsing . if i need your help , i'll let you know .
have you any beef today ?
yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . it is a weekend special .
how much is it a pound ?
one pound and fifty pence a pound .
good . i'll get three pounds of it .
here it is . four pounds and fifty pence in all .
have you got some nice apples in stock today ?
what about these ? they are very fresh and exceptionally juicy .
are they sweet ?
very sweet .
how much are they ?
these are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each .
all right , i'll have a dozen of the dollar ones .
ok . anything else ?
do you have any tangerines ? i'd like to have two kilograms .
yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from tailband . here they are .
how much is it in all ?
thirty dollars .
what is your policy on returns ?
if you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free .
sounds good .
that'll be $ 70 , please . will you be paying by cash or charge ?
charge . here's my card .
okay , sir , here you are . thank you very much .
i'll try one of these on . ( the customer tries one of the shoes on . ) it's too big . it slides up and down my heel when i walk around .
well , let's try a size ten . ( he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) looks like a perfect fit .
not really . it pinches my toes .
i'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in .
i don't know ... well , i guess i'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better .
thank you , ma'am . it's been a pleasure doing business with you .
you look fresh recently . and .. what's your weight now ?
110 pounds .
really ? congratulations ! that's really something beyond my imagination . how did you make it ? did you keep on a diet ?
no , you know i can't bear eating less .
then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
i've quit it already . i go to aerobics class everyday instead .
how's it going on ?
you see . i've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
i'd better exercise my body too . my limbs are rusty now .
i don't think so . you look full of energy every day . time has stood still with you .
good morning . welcome to time after time watches .
i'd like to buy a watch .
well , you've come to the right place . what kind of watch are you looking for ?
well , i'm not sure . let's see . how much is this one ?
hmm ... this rolex ? $ 1,000 .
oh . i don't think i can afford that . how about this one ?
this one is $ 500 .
wow . that's too much for me . don't you have anything cheaper ?
the total cost is 850 dollars . how would you like to pay ?
by credit card .
we take visa and master card .
do you take american express ?
no , we don't .
ok , i'll use my visa . here you are .
what'll it be today , sir ?
fill it up . super unleaded .
shall we check your oil and tires ?
i just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires .
( the attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) all right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 .
i'll charge it . here's my card .
let me suggest this one . it's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 .
hmm . that's not too bad . does it have a stopwatch ?
uh , no . analog watches don't come with stopwatches . you'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch .
oh . i see . where are your digital watches ?
right here .
i don't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i'll take that other one . do you take checks ?
yes . make it out to time after time .
here you are .
may i help you ?
what's the price of the bread ?
2.50 yuan .
and how much is the coca cola ?
3.00 yuan .
here is ten yuan .
here is your change , please .
thank you .
that's $ 60 in all .
here is my card . can i have them delivered to this address ?
sure . you can go to the front desk to ask for more help .
ok , thank you .
excuse me , can i order now , please ?
ok , what would you like ?
i'd like the lasagna , please .
sure and which one would you like ?
the skirt looks beautiful . can i try it on ?
of course .
well , i think this one is a little too small . would you please bring me a bigger one ?
i am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . but you might be lucky at our branch .
is this a duty-free shop ?
yes , sir . what can i do for you ?
i want to buy some specialties . can you recommend me some ?
sure . i strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
fine . they look nice . i will take both of them .
may i have a look at your passport , please ?
ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in china . it seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles .
you got it ! in a sense , it has become a byword for chinese sport .
what do you think might be the source of its popularity ?
i think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . all you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ...
and sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks .
put it there ! in senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket .
haha , these are very good inventions . all these speak the public's fondness for the sport
yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every tom , dick and jane in this developing country . no wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it .
i know president hu into likes playing ping-pong .
actually , he excels in it . chairman mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign .
how do you feel ?
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
here is the bigger size .
this one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ?
good evening , sir . what's your pleasure ?
give me a shot of whisky and soda .
with or without ice , sir ?
certainly without ice . ice will spoil the taste .
would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( pouring soda )
whoa , when .
she's a persian . she has papers and everything . not like a street dog .
cats chase mice , don't they ?
and bugs . they can catch anything .
do you have to walk a cat ?
no , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.thev ' re so smart .
but then you have to change the litter box .
good evening , sir . what's your pleasure this evening ? your usual ?
yes . i'm going to stay with the same , a beer .
certainly , a beer . here you are , sir .
oh , darn . look what i've done . ( spill the drink )
i'm getting so paunchy that i'm afraid i have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and i think i must go on a diet .
you are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy .
you know , i'm a compulsive overeater . i got to watch what i eat .
more physical exercise may help to keep your weight down .
hi . can i help you ?
no , thanks . i ’ m just looking around .
okay . please let me know if you need any help .
thanks a lot .
is this where i can catch a bus to the theater ?
yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
which bus do i have to change ?
you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
morning , tom ! what are you doing over there ? learning to dance ?
can't you see ? i'm practicing tai chi !
oh , my goodness . i'm sorry . but i don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .
i'm just a beginner . did my poses make me the butt of jokes ?
well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you .
so , is there anything wrong with my strokes ?
to begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time .
like this ?
good ! and then , the entire body . never incline your body forward or backward . take care to regulate the point of balance . place it at your waist .
did i do it right ?
no ! you should avoid sticking out your belly . keep your hip steady . don't swing .
what should i do with my legs then ?
oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . keep your knees bent a little . right , they should be rich in elasticity . move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another .
fantastic ! i guess the same is true with the arms , right ?
excuse me , i'm looking for the holiday inn . do you know where it is ?
sure . it's down this street on the left .
is it far from here ?
no , it's not far .
how far is it ?
about a mile and a half .
how long does it take to get there ?
5 minutes or so .
is it close to the subway station ?
yes , it's very close . the subway station is next to the hotel . you can walk there .
excuse me , driver . does this bus go to the museum ?
yes , you get off at the square .
how long is the ride ?
well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy .
thank you.how much is the fare ?
drop 50 cents in the box , please .
would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? i am a stranger here .
sure . i will .
excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the today mall ?
yes , go down the fifth street . you won't miss it .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it's only about 10 minutes ' walk .
now that you have learned kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ?
i think , maybe , it takes a real kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , i am no more than a beginner . but i really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life .
you mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? to some extent your idea holds water . kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . now we are apt to treat it as an art .
an art ! you have a good point there . so it is called martial arts in english . the chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . they even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating .
thanks for your compliment ! perhaps the chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . do you know jin yong ?
i know he is a martial arts fiction writer . but i've read none of his novels .
all of his works have been translated into english . i recommend you to read one or two works of his . you'll get a general glimpse into chinese kung fu culture . when you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life .
i see . they must have incorporated a series of chinese cultural elements .
yes , take philosophy , for instance . what makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? it's not enough only to be formidable . it also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life .
so kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ?
julia , look at me ! i'm gaining weight . how could i lose weight ? do you have any good ideas ?
since summer is coming , i think swimming is a good way for you to do .
are you sure ?
of course ! swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body .
really ? does swimming have other advantages ?
it could also help you increase vital capacity .
that ’ s great . okay , from now on i would swim three times a week . i hope i can get rid of the weight .
you will make it if you persist in it .
look , i've got a problem here . will you help me ?
i'm not sure if i can , but i'll try .
how may i help you , miss ?
i want to change my hairstyle . what would you suggest ?
would you like to have a perm ?
do you think it will suit me ?
oh , absolutely .
ok , i'll have it for a change .
would you do me a favor ?
i'd be glad to . what is it ?
hello . my name ’ s linda brown . what can i do for you today ?
hi . i ’ m tom peterson . i ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment .
certainly . first , i would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before i show you what we have .
that ’ s fine .
what price range are you interested in ?
well , between $ 350-400 a month .
okay . do you have a special location in mind ?
i ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line .
when would you like to move in ?
as soon as possible .
how about the end of this month ?
fine .
are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ?
i would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning .
okay . here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences .
thank you . this one looks nice . is it near the university ?
yes . it ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus .
that ’ s good . i ’ d like to see it .
excuse me . i'm afraid i got lost . where am i on this map ?
we are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
oh ! can i go from here to the zhongshan park ?
head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
okay , i ’ ll take it . by the way , do you have delivery service ?
you don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service .
do you charge for delivery ?
wo will deliver the goods to you for free .
very good . could you deliver it to this address ?
sure . please write down your name and your phone number .
ok . can you tell me the delivery time ?
no later than tomorrow .
hi , i'd like to have a beer .
hi , good evening . which kind of beer would you like ?
i'd like to try a local beer . what would you suggest ?
how about yanking beer ? it's very popular here .
good evening , sir .
good evening . i'll have a scotch .
yes , sir . straight or on the rocks ?
on the rocks , please .
hello , ma'am . can i help you ?
yes , please . i'd like a gin and tonic .
sure , ma'am . here you are .
thank you . how much is it ?
25 yuan .
here's 30 . keep the change .
excuse me . i wonder if you could help me . i'm looking for the oriental pearl theater .
boy , you are lost . it's across town .
oh ! what bad luck ! how can i get to the theater ?
you can take a no . 12 bus here and then transfer to a no . 23 bus to get there .
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ?
i don't think dieting is good for you . it's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .
so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
sure , they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .
how about drinking soda ?
many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke .
that's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but i don't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
you might not believe this , but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
i'm sorry , but i didn't catch what you said .
i said , " do you want me to help you ? "
if you're sure you're not in a hurry , i can use a little help .
ok . would you like me to get you a cab ?
hi , mark .
hi , bill . i ’ d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday .
all right .
so , what do we do now ?
this is the lease . you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
okay . ( reads the lease ) so , according to the lease , i ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and i have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . i understand that i ’ ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
yes . if you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .

do you have any plans for dinner tonight ?

i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?

yeah , why not . do you have all the ingredients ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start !
what do we do first ?
first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
ok . should i heat the wok ?
yes . once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes .
what about the chicken ?
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through .
how about the rice ?
i'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
white rice , please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !

that's very nice of you . i guess i could use some help .
just tell me what you'd like me to do .
sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ?
i'll have to look . what do you want it for ?
i need it for the parking meter .
i can give you quarters , if that'll help .
laura , what are you going to do today ?
i'm going shopping .
what time are you leaving ?
i'm going to leave around 4 o'clock .
will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store ?
ok .
do you have enough money ?
i'm not sure .

what's your name ?
addison .
ok . which facial would you like ? we have five different kinds of facials .
which would you recommend ?
well , since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun , i'd recommend our summer special . it's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
what does it include ?
the facial will start with a thorough cleansing .
does it include a facial mask and a massage ?
yes . the stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . you can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well .
will you exfoliate the skin as well ?
yes . we'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun .
that sounds great . i'll have that one then .

i said , " is there anything i can do ? "
if it's not too much trouble , i would like some help .
it's no trouble at all . i'll carry this suitcase for you .

yes .

nothing . the landlord pays .

yes . each apartment has one .
are there any parking lots for the tenants ?
yes . but you need to pay $ 60 for it each month .
is there an alarm system in the apartment ?
yes . we set up the new alarm system a few months ago .
who will take responsibility for the heating system if it has a problem ?
of course we do . it is the landlord ’ s responsibility .
are smoke detectors provided ?
yes .
hi , i ’ m cindy , the office clerk . what can i do for you ?

yes , please .
can you tell me the postal code for this building ?
yes , it ’ s l8v 4b7 .
thank you . also , how can i get my mailbox key ?

who ’ s peter ?
he ’ s the superintendent of this building .
thanks a lot . i ’ ve got one more question .
no problem . go ahead , please .
where can i change the address on my driver ’ s license ?
the department of motor vehicles office is at 212 barton street north .
can you give me directions to the office ?
we are at 2368 king street east .
yes .
so , it ’ s easy to get to the office from here . from your apartment , just drive along king street east for about one kilometer and you ’ ll see a three-story blue building on your right . that ’ s the department of motor vehicles building where you can change your driver ’ s license .
what floor is the office on ?
it ’ s on the first floor .
thank you very much .
come on in . let me show you around . here ’ s the living room .
great . the view from this window is wonderful .
this is the kitchen .
it looks new .
yes . we just renovated a few month ago .
i like it .
here ’ s the master bedroom .
wow , it ’ s nice . what did you say about the rent ?
$ 900 a month .
does that include utilities ?
yes . it includes electricity , water , gas and cable , but the telephone is extra .
when will it be available ?
the end of this month .
i like it a lot but i need to talk with my wife . can you hold it for me for two days ?
sure .
thank you very much . i will let you know as soon as possible .
i'm afraid i have to return this sweater .
may i ask if there's anything wrong with it ?
you see , there is a run at the neck .
oh , sorry.but do you want to change it for another one ?
i want to lose some weight !
so do i !
i have a yoga class tomorrow . do you want to come with me ?
no , it's too expensive for me . i've decided to take some exercises on my own .
what are you going to do ?
run around the track . in the morning i run for an hour , and in the afternoon i run around the building .
good , i am sure it will work if you can persist .
i hope so . would you like to join me ?
you are in the pink recently . how do you make it ?
well , i attend an aerobic class three times a week .

ok ! see you later !
hi , i ’ m ray , your tenant in room 209 .
hi . what ’ s up ?
there ’ re some problems in my apartment . first , the faucet in the bathtub drips constantly .
okay , i ’ ll ask my plumber to come by and fix it today . what else ?
one of the burners on the stove doesn ’ t work .

i can ’ t control the temperature .
i ’ ll get an electrician to repair it as soon as possible . is that everything ?
well , there ’ s one more thing . the telephone is dead .
i ’ m sorry . there ’ s nothing i can do about that . you ’ ve got to call the phone company .
okay . thank you very much .
you ’ re welcome .
( at the met station ) hurry up ! we are running late for school .
let's take the met . lt's faster and cheap .
which line should we take if we go to danshui ?
we should take the red line . let's get the tickets at the automatic vending machine .
how much money should i insert in the slot ?
5o dollars . later you have to place your ticket near the sensor .
i see .
it's so crowded . all the seats are taken . let's go there . there is a seat over there .
it's a priority seat . we can not sit there . we should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people .
yeah , you are right . let's stand . it takes only about 20 minutes .
if we go to danshui in the morning on a weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour .
anyway , we are arriving at danshui soon . i can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset .
are you ready for your first driving lesson ?
yes . which one is the brake again ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
i ’ m glad this car is an automatic . i don't like having to change gears .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat !
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
i can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit , please ?
how ’ s that ?
that ’ s better . now what ?
check your petrol situation .
the tank is almost empty . i guess i ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
that ’ s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway .
i got it . don ’ t worry . i ’ ll get you there in one piece .
remember , no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
hello , do you remember me ? i bought some vases from you yesterday .
eyes , you sent them to new york , right ?
that's right . i thought i'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
what did you have in mind ?
well , first , i'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that , too .
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
yes , we do . they're on the wall behind you .
how much do they cost ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
yes , i think i'd like the green mask in the middle .
here you go .
i'll take it , i'd also like to buy some chocolate .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
we've got plenty to choose from here .
hello , can i help you ?
yes . i ’ m looking for something to wear to a formal party .
what dress size do you wear ?
medium , a woman ’ s size 10 or 12 .
this dress is the latest fashion form paris . it ’ s made of pure silk . and this silk blouse would go with this skirt . do you like it ?
yes .
why don ’ t you try it on and see how you feel about it ?
that ’ s a great idea . i ’ ll try it on .
how does that feel ?
it feels very good .
you look wonderful .
okay . i ’ ll take it . thank you very much .
hello , frank .
hi , steven . what's new with you ?
not too much . i'm looking to rent an apartment .
why ?
i dislike my roommate . he really turns me off .
what happened ? did you have a fight ?
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
i hate that , either . did you tell him your feelings ?
yes . but he doesn't care . i really wouldn't want to move , but i simply can ’ t stand him .
it's a problem . you'd better move .
so , how should we get to the theatre ?
let's take the bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
it's not that bad . you probably just had a bad experience once .
it wasn't just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . should we take the bus ?
we're already late , so i think we had better take a taxi .
i don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . let's just take the bus .
fine . have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . nothing bad will happen . i'll even buy your ticket for you .
thanks , that was nice of you .
see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes , what are your hours ?
we open at lo
thanks lot .
how does it fit ?
it fits fine . i ’ ll take it . how much is it ?
the price is on the tag . how would you like to pay ?
do you take credit cards ?
yes , we do .
great . here's my visa credit card .
here's your receipt . thank you for shopping here and have a nice day .
thank you .
have you been served , sir ?
i am just looking , thank you ... excuse me . can you tell me where i can buy a pair of shoes ?
it's on the fourth floor .
thank you .
good afternoon , anything i can do for you ?
yes , i am after some sugar .
well , we have some nice sugar .
can you show me the way , please ?
oh , dear . my weight has gone up again .
i'm not surprised . you eat too much .
and i suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help .
yes , i think so .
i do wish i could lose weight
well , why don't you go on a diet ?
i've tried diets before but they've never worked .
perhaps you should exercise more . why don't you go to an exercise class ?
excuse me . do you know how to get to the mall ?
sure , i used to work there . go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . the mall will be on the right .
do you know the address ?
yes , the address is 541 main street .
can you write it down for me please ?
no problem .
is it faster if i take highland avenue ?
no , that way is longer . there are more stop lights on that street .
hello . i want to send the computer to my sister in shanghai by logistics transport .
ok . is it in the box ? may i see it ?
yes . this is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
is there anything else ?
there are a mouse and a camera .
is that all ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
it depends on the weight of these things . generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
i see . can you weigh them for me , please ?
please go over there to weigh them .
what can i do for you , sir ?
i want to have a bath .
do you want to have a tub bath , surfing bath or shower ?
shower , please .
all right . the fitting room is over there .
how much should i pay ?
excuse me . can i open a postal savings account in your office ?
of course . what kind of postal savings account do you want to open ?
hum .. can you recommend me one with high interest ?
ok . we offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . they have different interest rates .
i want the one with the highest interest rate .
that would be our savers plus account . you must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . in this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
all right . i'ii open this one .
just fill out these forms , and i ’ ll be with you in one second .
can i help you ?
yes . i'd like this shirt to be dry-cleaned .
sure . when do you want to get it back ?
i have to wear it this afternoon . do you have a urgent service ?
yes , but we charge 50 % more and it only takes 3 hours .
ok . how much should i pay ?
i'm really sorry , but i seem to have misplaced your towel .
oh , that's all right .
i'm very sorry . can i get you another one ?
no . forget about it . it's not important .
what can i do for you ?
yes . there is something wrong with my watch . it stopped several hours ago .
let me have a look . oh , the watch ’ s battery is worn down .
how much is a battery ?
$ 50 .
how long will it last ?
about 2 years .
here is the money .
good morning , sir . may i help you ?
yes , thank you . i want to get a handbag .
do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend ?
no , i have no girlfriend .

i'm so hungry ! i haven't late eaten all day !
take your mind off it . look , crys.this magazine is on china's top ten beauties !
they're all so thin ! her cheekbones are great .
she doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face .
the mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . if only we could be that thin then ...
not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that .
oh , bathroom blues .
look at this girl's gray dress .
i went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small .
last time i wore extra small was when i was in fifth grade .
( weigh herself ) hey , i lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . if i keep going , i can wear that dress next month .
so why are you dieting this time anyway ? another guy ?
dieting . it's the price we pay to make men notice us .
the girls in this magazine are so slender .
they're also way younger than us .
true.you know , i first started dieting when i was ten .
you never worked out ?
oh , no . too much work . i hate to sweat . it's so gross .
my aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape .
i just got it at the special health store . it's for my flabby arms .
let me know how it works .
i have to say , i have had enough of this roller coaster .
i know what you mean . i'm like a yo-yo .
last week i was down to 60 kilos . this week i had one donut more . now i'm up to 62 kilos .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i want a shirt .
what about this one ? it sells like hot cakes .
well , do you have the same in black ?
are you looking for something special ?
yes , where can i buy trousers ?
follow me , please . how do you like this one ?
what mark is it ?
have you any round-neck sweater ?
yes . actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .
can i try this one on ?
sure , go ahead .
my stomach's growling again !
you'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach .
just a little steak , uh ... snack ? a bowl of clam chowder ?
you want to be beautiful , don't you ? think about the butter and flour in ...
you're right . but if i get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again .
most models only eat once a day . if they can do it , so can we .
you know . soup , well , society makes us like this .
i think you're hallucinating ! what are you talking about ?
well , thin is always " in " with the media .
and your point is ?
if you aren't thin , you're nobody .
i agree with you , but i think people are pretty bad , too .
you lost me .
people are always gossiping about one another .
yeah , but that's human nature .
we can be so critical of one another .
may i help you ?
yes , do you have sweaters ?
this way , please . how do you like this one ? it's made of cotton .
you have quite a range , haven't you ? i would like to see some other styles .
have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
not yet . i don't know how to fill out the form . what is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
i don't really know . why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . he can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
if i don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
i am looking for a blouse . can you show me the way , please ?
ok , what style do you want ?
i have no idea . could you recommend me one ?
what about this one ? it fits you .
we have a variety of trousers . which one do you like best ?
i want to buy one to match my shirt.can you give me some advice ?
what about this one ?
yes , they seem to be my size and go with my shirt quite well . i will take it .
have you a garment ?
yes , what style do you prefer ?
show me the black one , my size .
ok , here you are .
would you please bring me the black suit ? i want to try it on .
here you are .
i think this suit fits perfectly .
yes , i think so . the suit matches the trousers .
can i help you ?
yes , i want to buy a suit .
what about the red one ? it's the best seller .
yeah , it's quite cute . i don't think it will fit me . i would prefer a darker color . have you a black one ?
check the mirror . how do you like it ?
i think the style is a little old-fashioned . it's not what i want .
i think this one fits you . it's the new fashion style .
oh , yes . that's just the one i want . i will take it .
well , this is not quite the style i want . have you any suit in fashion ?
how is this one ? it's the latest , made of cashmere .
can i try it on ?
sure .
we need to do a group report tomorrow . i need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters .
you need to make posters ?
absolutely . every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas .
i see . then let's make a shoppingliist first before we go there.othe rise , it may take us a whole day to search for the things you need .
no problem . i need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers ..
wow , it is like a maze , i think i might get lost soon .
don't worry.in fact , it is very easy to find what you want . can you see the sign on top of every shelf . it clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf .
oh , yes . you are so smart . i see them . so i have to go to shelf number 3 first to get my markers , color pencils and highlighters and somebrushes .
i also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . which shelf are they on ? i can't find the number .
it's at the back . i think you are near-sighted . you had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses .
what can i do for you ?
i am looking for a pair of trousers . do you have any good ideas ?
what about jeans ? it's the fashion now .
i don't like it . actually i am looking slacks .
then , how about this ?
it seems all right . do you have pantaloons ?
did you smell something ? it smells so great .
it must come from the bakery on the corner.they are baking cookies . their cookies are very popular in town .
how come i never knew that ? do they have a new baker or something ?
i think so . the bakery invited a famous baker from the usa . he is good at making cookies .
let's go and get some cookies . i am hungry now .
look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , i am thinking about buying one .
you can taste some before you buy it . they have food tasting at the counter .
i am starting loving this bakery now .
it's one of my favorite bakeries .
you should have told me earlier . i am a cookie lover .
can your dog do any tricks ?
sure he can . he can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead .
i wish i had a dog . my cat can't do any tricks .
yeah , but sometimes bingo wants to play with me , but i don't have time .
so who takes care of him then ?
my little brother likes to play with him . he even gives him a bath every week .
i can't do that with my cat . she hates water .
you know , you're right . maybe you should get a dog .
your dog is really cute . what's his name ?
his name is bingo .
what kind of dog is he ?
we're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away .
well , he sure likes to run around a lot . is he well behaved ?
oh yes , he is . when he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now .
that sounds like my cat . she likes to scratch the couch with her claws .
i didn't know you had a cat . when did you get her ?
about a year ago actually . you've probably never seen her though .
really ? why is that ?
she's not a house-cat . she stays outside most of the time .
bingo could never do that . he stays in the house except when we take him to the park .
excuse me . check please .
ok , how was everything ?
very nice . thank you .
would you like this to-go ?
yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?
sure , no problem . here you are . that'll be 25 dollars .
do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept visa and mastercard .
ok , here you are .
thanks . i'll be right back .
ok .
here's your receipt .
thank you .
you're welcome . please come again .
michelle , can you help me clean things up before we go ?
sure . where should i put this cup ?
which cup ?
the red one .
put it on the table .
how about this fruit ?
oh , that goes in the refrigerator .
and those pencils ? what should i do with them ?
bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom .
how about this pen ?
give it to me . i need to use it .
what do you want me to do with that paper over there ?
you can throw that away . i don't need it anymore .
the trash is full .
alright , then please put it in a bag and take it outside .
ok . now what ?
i think we're finished . can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ?
sure .
i want to buy a shirt .
what color do you like ?
a white one , please .
maybe you could have a look at this one .
what's the size ?
large .
if you like you can try it on.the fitting room is in the corner .
ok . what do you think of it ?
i think it fits you . it flatters your figure .
i think so . but can i try another one ? i don't like the color .
may i try this on ?
sure . the color is perfect for you .
what material is it made of ?
it's made of cotton .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes , i am looking for a skirt . what's in fashion now ?
this one is the latest . how do you like it ?
well . could i try it on ?
sure .
( a moment later ) it's cute.the color suits my complexion .
have you been taken of , miss ?
i am looking for a t-shirt .
we have quite a variety of shirts here .
what kind of material is this ?
silk . you have a good taste . it's excellent for its handiness , elegance and beauty .
can i try it on ?
ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ?
oh , yeah ! he can sit down , roll over , and even play dead .
really ? does he chase balls ?
yup.hey , do you want to see a picture ? see , he's eating lunch .
this can't be the same dog . he's so clean , he shines .
see , he's wagging his tail .
what's the latest fashion of evening gown ?
the one on the manikin is in fashion now .
i would like to try on one in violet .
ok , here you are . you look really attractive in that gown .
may i be of any help ?
yes . show me the sweaters , please .
what style ?
well , could you bring me all the styles of pullovers ? i am not quite sure which one i will buy .
where do you want to go ?
i am going to the capital hotel .
get in . i will take you there .
about how much it will cost ?
$ 50 .
on the meter ?
ye , of course .
ok.let ' s go .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i want a chemise .
you have really good taste . it's the best seller right now .
could i try it on ?
sure .
well . it's not my taste . would you please bring me a short sleeve ?
the bartender just gave the last call . let's order another round , okay ?
sure , but let's get a pitcher this time . we should be able to down it before they close .
that sounds good . you order the beer while i go to the bathroom . where is the can in this place ?
it's all the way to the back . see that yellow door ?
yeah . i think i can find it .
you're back already . that sure was quick .
that's because i just took one step inside and turned right around . that bathroom is too gross for me .
well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer.anyway.he said it was too close to closing time .
let's leave then . i could take some fresh air , anyway .
okay , let's go !
now , madam , here is the hotel .
what's the fare ?
$ 15 .
the fare is different from the meter .
well , madam , the meter was not on at all . you didn't tell me .
but i thought it was . anyway . i am in a hurry . here is the money .
excuse me , driver . let me off here , please .
well , it's not the supermarket you want .
i have just changed my plan .
ok .
excuse me , ma ' am . i would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to london . it is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days .
no problem . but , the postage is much higher than the regular package .
that's fine with me . i am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time .
ok . all the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days .
i see . how much do i need to pay in total for this package ?
it's 500 dollars .
can i have the receipt ? just in case i can trace it if something goes wrong .
sure ! please just fill in your i . d . number and ways to contact you here .
do i need to include my zip code in the address ?
you had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address .
thank you very much . here is 500 dollars .
here is your receipt . contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days .
thank god , it's friday ! time for a drink ! let's hit the bars !
ok . i don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you .
should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ?
i think i'll have a glass of wine . let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . they even have sangria ! it's the happy hour special .
port's too sweet . it's a dessert wine . a dry red french wine would be nice with meat . a glass of chilled white german wine would be good with fish . but , we're not eating and it's hot out , so i think i'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice .
good choice ! but , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ?
excuse me , can i have a look at the green coat ?
certainly . here you are . it's a new arrival .
yes , i like the style.can i try this on ?
sure . the fitting room is in the corner .
it's a beautiful day ! let's play on those rides in the park .
sounds like a good idea . i love to play on the jungle gym .
me too . i love to play on the swing as well . swing is my favorite .
that's great . then we won't fight over taking the same ride .
look at the flowers over there . what are they ?
they are morning glories . they are cute , aren't they ?
they are . we can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park .
i think so . last time i saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond .
if you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn .
it's really healthy to do some exercise there . the air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover .
do you have sport shirts for ladies ?
there are different types . which one do you like best ?
i think the red one fits me well . can i try it on ?
surely , of course .
where is the fitting room ?
it's there , near the mirror .
the dress looks beautiful . can i touch it ?
i am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it .
i see . what about the dress over there ? i would like to try it on .
ok , here you are . the fitting room is behind the curtain .
are you looking for shoes ?
yes , could you give me some ideas ?
what about this brown one ?
fine , it's the thing for me . i will take it .
can i try this dress on ?
sure.the fitting room is right behind you .
well , i like the styte , but i don't think the color fits me . could you bring me a green one ?
sure , wait a moment .
could you give me some advice ?
the dress is made on your measurement .
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color , i will like it better .
ok , maybe you can try this one on . it's yellow .
oh , my god . i am so heavy now . i gain 10 kilos .
i am going to the gym . do you want to come with me ?
i think i should go . i really need to lose some weight .
then , i'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes .
0k.see you then .
do you have your member card with you ?
nope , i do not have a membership yet .
well i have a guest ticket . you can use it .
i can't find my glasses and i can't see anything . can you help me find a few things ?
no problem . what are you looking for ?
my laptop , do you see it ?
yes , your laptop is on the chair .
where's my book ?
which one ?
the dictionary .
it's under the table .
where's my pencil ?
there's a pencil in front of the lamp .
that's not a pencil . that's a pen .
oh , sorry . there is a pencil behind the cup .
how about my backpack ? do you know where that is ?
it's in between the wall and the bed .
where are my shoes ?
they're on the left side of the tv .
i don't see them .
sorry , i made a mistake . they're on the right side of the tv .
thanks .
oh , and here are your glasses . they were next to your cell phone .
this one is too small . please bring me a bigger one .
ok .
what's the brand ?
leopard . it's famous brand of good quality .
i want to buy a black suit .
certainty.do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
i prefer single breasted suit .
what about this one ? it's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
could i be of any help to you ?
i want to buy a skirt , but i have no idea which one to buy .
do you like miniskirt ? it's popular among young girls . the pleated skirt also sells well .
i don't like to keep up with joneses .
what about the divided skirt ?
i think this suits me . can i try it on ?
do you have the same in different sizes ? the trousers are too long for me .
let me see . yes , here you are .
will the trousers shrink when washed ?
no , they won't . they are shrink proof .
do you get up early every morning ?
about 6 in the morning . i like to walk to the office .
good habit . how long does it take ?
about 20 minutes . do you live alone ?
no , my little sister lives with me .
how old is she ?
about 12 . she is a good girl .
i think so .
ok , lucy.it ' s your turn.are you ready ?
i really would rather just listen.isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ?
come on ! in the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !
i know , but ... hey , stanley's here ! i've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
well , you asked for it . why don't you put on an elvis ' song for him .
i'll put the song at the front of the list .
who wants to go first ? lily ?
oh ... i mostly just like to listen . you're the groom . why don't you go first ?
ok.put on something by the backstreet boys !
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee brooke !
i've been learning to play go recently . it's an amazing game !
weigh ? it must be a greatest chinese invention . i've tried hard to learn it . its rules can't be any simpler , but i've never won a game of go . well , it's all greek to me !
at least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? i think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into chinese culture should learn to play go .
i heard it is included in the four major arts of china , is it ?
sure . it was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . i think weigh is the most fantastic of them . it embodies ancient chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .
i know it is quite different from western chess .
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game , i can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
but isn't it the same with wiki ?
may i take a look at the shoes over there ?
certainly . what's your size ?
size 24 . are they synthetic or leather ?
they are all leather . how do they feel ?
try it on in front of the mirror .
well , i think the color is a little too bright .
we have darker ones . do you like the style ?
yes . what's this made of and how to wash it ?
is stanley still singing that elvis song ? he's really hogging the mic !
if i hear love me tender one more time , i think i'll go crazy !
he sounds like a sick cow !
can we adjust the pitch a little ? maybe he'll sound better in a higher key .
i already tried that . nothing seems to help .
hey ! where are you going ... ?
let's go to burger queen for lunch . they have good cheese burgers .
ok . i am hungry , too . i like their milkshake . they're very creamy and tasty .
look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . it must be very delicious .
yup . but , this also means we have to wait to order our food .
come on . it is worth waiting . their cheese burgers are really popular . once you have it , you will love it .
well , sounds very attractive . i just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious .
yup , they have good french fries as well . not very thick , but crispy enough . you should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . that is the belgium style . you will love it .
ok , i think i know what to order for my lunch now . but , eating too much fried food really makes me fat .
come on . you just have it once in a while , not every day . it will not harm you .
that's true . you can hear my tummy grumbling . i am really hungry !
be patient . good food never comes fast .
ok !
hi , is you , john ?
oh , jane . what on earth have you been ? i've called you a thousand times .
sorry , john . i suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day .
but i called your cell phone , and there was no answer .
i know , i left it at home .
do you feel better now ?
i like chess better than xiangqi . and you ?
for my part , xiangqi . maybe it's because my girlfriend is chinese .
i think chess is more reasonable . you see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . a true battle should be like that . soldiers should outnumber the commanders .
quite right . and unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . it is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance .
correct ! another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . it seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . they are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . look at the king in chess , he is much more capable .
yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . i think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval europe than in china .
there's another distinctive contrast . both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess .
you mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ?
flip it to channel 9 , will you , janet ? there's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes .
sorry , turkey . i have already got dibs on the tv for tonight , remember ? and i'm watching ' disco fever ' on channel 6 .
oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? over my dead body . now , don't be such a brat and ...
hey , what's wrong with the tv ?
i don't know ! the picture went blank all of a sudden . it's probably the picture tube .
looks like the tv wins that argument .
yeah . oh well , how about a game of cards instead ?
sure , why not ?
do you have cheongsams ?
yes.we have in stock a variety of styles and they are in different colors.what do you think of this one ?
the styte is ok . which country is this made in ?
it's made in china . the quality is excellent .
can i help you in any way ?
i would like to see your summer suits .
how do you like this pattern ? the pink suits you well .
will it wash well and the color won't fade ?
do you want to buy a sweater ?
yes . which one is the latest ?
the cowl-neck pullovers are new in . it sells like hot cakes .
it's my style . will it be resistance to balling ?
may i help you ?
yes , i am looking for a coat .
do you have any style in your mind ?
i have no idea .
i recommend you this one . it's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing .
well , it's good in style , but i am afraid it doesn't wash well .
i think this suit displays your nice finger .
thank you . could you change it for a purple one ?
no problem .
will it shrink when washed ?
are you ready to go shopping ?
just a few minutes . i need to make a list of the things that we need .
good idea . have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ?
i forgot about the potatoes . oh , i almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . what kind of tea do you prefer ? green tea or flower tea ?
let's just get both . do you bring enough money ?
we don ’ t have enough cash , but i ’ ll take my credit card .
could i speak to mr . wu , please ?
who ’ s calling , please ?
this is kevin .
hold on a second , please .
this is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture .
i had planned to . i can bring some from my place . and there's some more at my parents ' .
do you have a bed ?
of course , i have . there is one in my old house . and i have another one from college at my parents ' house .
that's good . you can put one in this room and put the other one in that room .
yeah , it is a good idea . you can stay in my house for the night if you would like to .
yeah . by the way , can i take a shower ?
sure , but i don't have hot water , yet .
really ?
no , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . my phone should be working then , too .
well , do you want to go outside for dinner ?
yeah , i can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . let's go to the restaurant nearby . it's my treat .
hello . i am bili and i made an appointment with you to see the house .
glad to meet you . this way , please .
the house is a little too old .
but it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . the subway is nearby .
hello . manchester 6739792 .
hello . is that nicholas ?
nicholas ? nicholas nickleby ? no . he doesn't live here any more . he's moved to morecambe .
never ! do you know his new number ?
yes . i've got it somewhere . let me see . where did i put it ? ah - i remember , it's on the memo . here it is . do you have a pen to write it down ?
yes , i do . go on .
his number's 4945939 .
4945939 . marvellous ! thanks for your help .
slow down ! you can't exceed the speed limits .
no , i cann't . i'm in a hurry !
no , you can not . it is dangerous .
shut up ! now you are in my car , you should listen to me . or you can get off . i've told you i'm in a hurry . i don't want to waste time on the road .
good afternoon .
my goodness ! it ’ s the afternoon ? doesn ’ t the time fly ! do come in and sit down .
thank you .
what ’ s the time ? my watch has stopped .
it ’ s half past twelve .
when do you have lunch ?
from one to two .
what do you normally eat ?
we usually go to the cafeteria .
oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now .
( having lunch with joseph ) have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ?
sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
to begin with , i have to use chopsticks .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
certainly . after all , i've been here for two years . it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a chinese dinner table .
yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm in china . hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! you should not stab them vertically into the rice bow !
anything strange about that ?
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
oh , sorry ! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
excuse me . have you got the time ?
my watch says half past five .
does your watch keep good time ?
oh yeah . it loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
i like to drive on freeway .
don't drive too fast .
don't worry.there ' re few cars now .
be careful.it ' s dangerous to drive fast .
there's going to be a highway here .
that's better .
the traffic problem will soon be eased .
i think so .
how do you spend your day , helen ?
well , on weekdays i get up around ten . then i read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon .
really ? what time do you go to work ?
i start work at three .
and when do you get home at night ?
i get home pretty late , around midnight .
so what do you do , exactly ?
i'm a tv announcer . don't you recognize me ? i do the weather report on knt !
oh , look at those earrings , maria . they're perfect for you .
these red ones ? i'm not sure .
no , the yellow ones .
oh , these ? hmm ... yellow isn't a good color for me .
well , that necklace isn't bad .
which one ?
that blue one right there . how much is it ?
it's $ 42 ! ! that's expensive !
hello . 9-1- 1 . can i help you ?
i need the police .
what happened ?
my neighbor hit my brother on the head . he ’ s bleeding .
give me your address .
176 wooden street east .
all right . the police and an ambulance are on the way . in the meantime , find a clean cloth and press it firmly over the wound . this will slow the bleeding .
i will , but please hurry .
mum , pass me some more please !
tina , you should have more nutritious food . don't eat these crisps any more .
but the ads say they're most nutritious .
have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ?

what does mi mean ?
mi stands for middle initial .

let's go to the animal shelter .
what do you want to do ?
i want to get a puppy for my son .

and eat too much .
do you know which one he would like ?
oh , yes , i took him there yesterday . he showed me one that he really liked .
i bet you had to drag him away .
he wanted to take it home yesterday .
i wonder what he'll name it .
stand back from the door , please . let the passengers off . you can't get on until the other passengers get off .
how much is the fare , please ?
one dollar . drop it in the box . move to the rear of the bus . there are plenty of seats in the rear .

i just insert my debit card into the machine .
and it gives you money ?
well , it gives me money , but it's my own money .
oh . what good is that ? i thought it gave you free money .
operator . may i help you ?
yes . how do i get an outside line , please ?
just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . or we can place a call for you , if you want .

can you help me , please ? is there a public restroom near here ?
i'm sorry , but i don't think so .
oh , no ! ! my son needs a bathroom .
well , there's a department store on grant street . there are restrooms in the basement .
where on grant street ?
between second and third streets . the store is across from the hotel .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
it's time for your bath , young lady .
but , mom , i'm not dirty .
you need a bath every day .
why ?
because you don't want to smell bad .
i don't smell bad .
that's what you think .
if i smelled bad , i could smell me .
i can smell you .
i can smell you , too .
that's my perfume .
when can i wear perfume ?
yikes ! what was that noise ?
i had to blow my nose .
did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
did you hear that ?
of course i heard that . i thought a plane had crashed into your house .
it wasn't that loud .
i will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
okay . i'll take your word for it .
i thought you had an elephant in your house .
you're funny .
what did you say ? i think i've gone deaf .
i'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . i'll be right back .
hi , welcome to hal's computer world . can i help you with anything ?
yes , i'd like to buy a new computer , but i don't really know much about them . can you give me any suggestions ?
no problem . first of all , do you want to get a home computer or a laptop ?
laptops are more expensive , right ?
yes , they generally cost a little more .
i'll just get a regular home computer then . i don't think i'll need to lug my computer around with me .
i called hp about my computer .
what did they say ?
they said i need a new hard drive .
that's too bad . how much is a new one ?
it's not too much , only about $ 85 .
plus installation ?
no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
really ?
yes , it's just a couple of screws .
that's nice .
it's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
if my hard drive crashes , i'll just call you .
i'm going to take a nap .
you should unplug the phone .
that's a good idea .
do you want me to wake you in an hour ?
no , thanks . just let me sleep until i wake up .
i'll start dinner at 6:00 .
okay . i think i'll be awake by then .
if not , your nose will wake you up .
you mean i will smell the food cooking ?
you might even dream about dinner .
i don't think i'm going to dream about anything . i'm really tired .
have a nice nap .
something's wrong with my computer .
exactly what ?
all i get is a black screen .
what's the matter ?
i think i know , because this happened before .
what happened before ?
my hard drive crashed .
oh , no . that's bad news .
it sure is , but i'm going to call hp first , just to make sure .
will you lose all your files ?
no , i always back up my files .
you're smart .
do you want an ibm-compatible pc or a macintosh ?
i'm not sure . what's the difference ?
well , what do you plan to use your computer for ?
mostly just to browse the internet and send emails to friends .
welcome to game world . what can i do for you ?
i'd like to get a good rpg . can you recommend any ?
sure . this one here just came out . it's got great 3d graphics and a cool story line . it's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the internet .
this one looks pretty good , but i'd like to see more before i make up my mind . do you have any other suggestions ?
this one is also really cool . it's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . the graphics on this one are spectacular .
hmm , it's a tough choice , but i think i'll go with this one .
i think i'll get some new goggles .
good idea . i'll get some , too .
we also need some sunscreen . what about beach towels ?
sure . we have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays .
i think i'll get a hat , too .
no hat for me , but i'm getting this cool pair of shades .
what kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
we usually eat chicken , pork and beef . you eat these meats a lot in your country too , don't you ?
yes , we do . we also eat mutton .
i've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
that's right . mutton chops taste so good . we eat them with sauce . have you ever tried ?
yes , i have . i tried once when i visited your country last year . i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
certainly i can . i'll buy some from the butcher's and cook for you next sunday .
that sounds great . i'll bring a bottle of wine then .
so are you going to get a new swimsuit ?
yeah , i think i'll get this one-piece .
why don't you get a bikini ?
i'm too fat for a bikini .
you aren't fat . i'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . how about this thong bikini ?
i'll wear that if you'll wear these speedos .
this is a good basic computer package . it's got a good cpu , 256 megabytes of ram , and a dvd player .
does it come with a modem ?
yes , it has a built-in modem . you just plug a phone line into the back of the computer .
how about the monitor ?
a 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . if you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money .
that's okay . a 15 - inch is good enough . all right , i'll take it .
are you ready ?
ready for what ?
ready for the big switch .
what are you talking about ?
the nation is switching to digital tv .
oh . of course i'm ready .
did you buy the converter ?
no , i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv .
how much was that ?
it was only about $ 120 for a 13 - inch screen .
does it pick up any digital channels ?
oh , yes . i get six korean channels but nothing in english !
you're in great shape , keith . do you work out at a gym ?
yeah , i do . i guess i'm a real fitness freak .
so , how often do you work out ?
well , i do aerobics every day after work . and then i play racquetball .
say , i like racquetball , too .
oh , do you want to play sometime ?
uh ... how well do you play ?
pretty well , i guess .
well , all right . but i'm not very good .
no problem , rod . i won't play too hard .
look ! it is not working well . did you try out the bike when you bought it .
no , there ’ s no need . we can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged .
but it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride .
i know . i will pay attention to such a thing next time .
this is no . 1 bus , bound for sihun .
excuse me . i will go to wangfujing , where should i get off ?
there are another six stops .
we are arriving at tiananmen . please get ready for your arrival .
is it wangfujing ?
no , sir . the next stop is wangfujing .
ok .
please get ready .
thank you .
we are arriving at wangfujing . please get ready .
is this where i get off ?
yes .
may i take your order ?
yes . i'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please .
all right . and would you like a salad ?
yes . i'll have a mixed green salad .
ok . what kind of dressing would you like ? we have vinaigrette , italian , and french .
italian , please .
and would you like anything to drink ?
yes , i'd like a large soda , please .
could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ?
he's a bright boy , isn't he ?
but he always wimps out of difficulty .
don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
did you put the blue bin out on the street ?
oh , no . i forgot .
well , you'd better take it out front .
what time does the recycle truck come by ?
it usually gets here at noon on tuesday , which is tomorrow .
i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning .
oh , no , you don't .
what do you mean ?
every morning you get up late and rush off to work late .
do you think i'll forget to do it ?
you'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it .
okay , i'll take it out front right now .
excuse me . i'm your new neighbor , jack . i just moved in .
oh . yes ?
i'm looking for a grocery store . are there any around here ?
yes , there are some on pine street .
ok . and is there a laundromat near here ?
well , i think there's one across from the shopping center .
thank you .
by the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too .
is this the right bus for san francisco ?
it sure is.can i see your ticket ? ok , fine .
when's the first stop ?
about two hours out of los angeles . give me the bags , i'll put'em on the bus . here's your claim tag . don't lose it.when you get off the bus , give it to me .
thank you .
is it all right to smoke on the bus ?
sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . and alcohol is not allowed .
i see . thank you .
now i'm sure we'll never get all our things back . they're so clever these criminals . what's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ?
i only wish it were this time yesterday .
think how happy we were . now this.things always go wrong .
perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . we'd feel better .
i don't feel like breakfast . i don't feel like anything . why are we so unlucky ? it's as if there were a jinx on us .
perhaps i'd better ring the police ...
jane ! what an enchanting skirt you have on !
thank you ! guess how much it costs .
bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... darling , it looks elegant on you ! it can't be any cheap stuff . something around two hundred , i guess .
your offer is way off the mark . it set me back only sixty-five .
then you got a windfall ! was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?
neither . i drove a hard bargain with the vendor before i got the price down .
how much did she ask for ?
three hundred ! that's daylight robbery . how dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? without hesitation , i gave my offer---no more than fifty .
she must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ?
not at all ! she's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . that's the trade . she only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . she was lying ! then i inquired , ' may i have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head .
then you pretended to go without buying it ?
yeah . i turned around and started to move out . just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! i may sacrifice a little . let's fix it sixty-five ! can't be cheaper . '
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china . it's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
cool down , harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ?
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on open-air fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just now i was told by my chinese colleagues i bought it overpriced . i could have talked my way to thirty .
is that so ? i'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it's the norm of free trade . the seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . yet you ignored the process . no wonder you ended up easy prey .
but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
of course , that's something really irritating . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . and then you may negotiate for a fair deal .
gosh , it's 7:30 , i'll miss the first class .
don't get up so late next time . you should have gone to bed earlier last night .
is your father in the habit of having naps ?
yes , all of us have naps .
don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ?
no , not at all .
when do you go to bed usually ?
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
that's helpful for your health .
sure .
are you ready , pa ?
in a second . have you got a torch ?
no .
here it is . let's go .
let's see if we forget anything .
oh , we need an umbrella . the weather is so changeable in that area .
yes , let's go . lock the door , please .
all right .
do you like the cookies ?
i finished them in no time .
glad you like it .
mum , when will we have them again ?
i'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?
ok , mum , when will you be back ?
why is the car before us stopping ?
what's going on ?
look . two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . that's why that car stops .
more and more people easily get irritated while driving .
good evening , madam . can i help you ?
yes . i bought this sheet here yesterday .
anything wrong with it ?
yes . when i spread it out back home , i found this hole .
oh , how awful ! may i have a look at the invoice ?
here it is .
well . please accept our sincere apologies , i'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
that's very kind of you . thank you .
would you like a cigarette ?
no , thanks . i've decided to give up smoking .
really ? why ?
well , it's just that i think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
i see.you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
that's right . you should give it up , too.it ' s bad for your health .
stop talking like my mother . that's what she keeps saying .
but it's true . it's a nasty habit . i can't think why i ever started.anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
