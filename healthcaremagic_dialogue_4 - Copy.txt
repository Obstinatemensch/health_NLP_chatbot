What are the chances of conception after treating the sore in womb?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hi DR i am 30years old with 1 child but i can't conceive i went to a doctor for check up  he told me that i have a big sore in my womb they have to operate me in order for me to conceive, so am askin whether if i can't remove that sore r the chances of gettin pregnet very slim or i can't conceive at all
Doctor:
hello. it must be a tumour not sore like fibroid or polyp. in both cases u have to get it operated.plz get an ultrasonography done and see whether its a fibroid or polyp alongwith its size. depending on size and location u can get it removed endoscopically and it wont affect ur fertility much rather it may improve ur chances of conception.

How to confirm date of conception during pregnancy?

Dialogue
Patient:
My daughter had an ultra sound on May 3rd that said she was 9 weeks pregnant. I also found out ( to my heartbreak) that she had sex with one boy on/around March the 6th and another boy on March the 20th. Based on her ultra sound is there a greater chance on which one would most likely be the father? The 9 weeks pregnant/7 weeks gestation has me confused
Doctor:
hi there, I will suggest you the best possible treatment options.As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycle, ovulation takes place around day 14 if the cycle.As per USG, she must have ovulated around 10th March. So the first unprotected sex activity,might be the most possible chance of her getting pregnant.I hope this answer helps you.Thanks.Dr. Purushottam Neurgankar

Hello  - My husband and I have been trying to concieve for 4 months now and still no baby.  I was practicing abstince for 2 years until we got married in September.  I had HPV and had to have the leep procedure done in May of 2013.  My periods are very irregular and its hard to keep up with when they are coming and how long as well as ovulation time. To make a long story short, I had my period for 2 day beginning 1/2/14 and it ended 1/3/14. After which there was spotting (brownish) in color for about a day and a half after.  My periods generally last 4 - 5 days so this was weird to me.  I have a few pregnancy symptoms such as headaches, breas heaviness and tenderness at times. Bloated tummy and gasey (burps/ flatulance), some days I unrinate a lot and some days I dont. I have this thick kinda cloudy and stretch discharge but no odor.  I have no cravings or sickness and  my appetite is a little more than usual but nothing major.  i took a pregnancy test last night and it was negative.  My husband and I last has sex on 1/1/14.  Am I reading too much into this, did I take the test too soon and is there any way that I could be pregnant?

I am curious if I could be pregnant? I started my period November 8th, lasting for 5 days. According to a "period" and "ovulation" calendar, I should have started December 6th or 8th. Today is December 16th and still no period. Makes 8 days with no period. I have taken a few pregnancy test and they all have came back negative. I have had some "period like cramps" for the past week and a half. Yesterday I started having a watery white discharge. I also have noticed an increase in discharge during the night. I have had unprotected sex all this past month. (A friend of mine missed her period and all her test came back negative, she was almost 6 weeks before she could get a positive pregnancy test.) Could I possibly be pregnant or am I just wanting it to bad? I go to the doctor on Tuesday, but would really appreciate all feedback now!
Doctor:
u do tmrw upt wid early morning sample. .if single line negative...u can confirm wid usg n blood hcg reports...delayed in periods can b due to pregnancy. ..stress..overweight. ..pcod...n ur cramps is probably due to premenstrual syndrome
